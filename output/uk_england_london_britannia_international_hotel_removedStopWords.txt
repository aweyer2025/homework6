May 27 2009 - Great student hostel business forget . hotel 's heyday 15 years ago hotel close Canary Wharf . tired , worn desperately ready makeover . Although room service staff polite helpful rest staff wiped . Particularly teenager behind bar spa ( broken trade descriptions act ) spoke rudely nearly checked . could give whole list unpleasant experiences hotel 4 nights wo n't . However , student , hotel full - 's great place hang . reason n't check Trip Advisor - big mistake .
May 19 2009 real problems . Stayed wife 3 nights middle May.The main reason visit sightseeing catching show two.I usually check tripadvisor book hotel 'm doubt err side caution book badly reviewed hotel . occasion daughter travel agent said sent people adverse comments bother checking first . 'm glad n't n't think would booked reading recent reviews.I found hotel clean tidy . reception staff efficient checked without problem . room although massive , perfectly adequate also clean appear need refurbishment etc reported previously . Everthing good state repair etc . ironing board , hairdryer trouser press although used hairdryer . travelling tourist tend use hotel sleeping possibly meal two size room major factor me.The bar staff also polite although bit slow side . also thought prices expensive even London.The real minus points thought breakfast expensive side ( £13.50 p.p . ) bother . simply got something eat shopping area Canary Wharf much reasonable . Also would nice something room told us time bar / restaurants open along idea price.The factor would probably put stopping within control hotel anyone else come . thought bit far away main tourist areas central London . found took 30 - 60 minutes get wanted . despite fact two tube / DLR stations within 5 minutes hotel . doubt perfectly placed O2 business Canary Wharf area . said outside control hotel minus point stay . reflected comment location score .
May 11 2009 Absolutely Fine ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 've never written reviews , wanted hotel people , like booked hotel & amp ; read awful reviews & amp ; started panic letting ! 've come back staying hotel friends wanted close O2 arena & amp ; absolutley fine . Whilst agree n't 4 * hotel anymore , room large ( triple room ) , clean bedding & amp ; towels , tea/coffee making facilities biscuits & amp ; bathroom adequate decent shower pressure . Check-in doddle & amp ; reception staff seemed nice.Having stayed sort understand points made : - yes room quite warm & amp ; air con n't seem lot , yes hear tube ( book hotel right next tube station really expect ! ! ) & amp ; yes rooms kitsch , overall price & amp ; location good.If wanted hotel near O2 fair price , would definatley stay .

May 5 2009 Great rooms lounge area restaurants bar open late good service . traveled large group high school students hotel . would recommend large rooms baths , large lobby lounge . restaurants bar open 2:00 food beverages hotel easily accessed tube , far enough London center students could leave hotel night . could convene lobby area cards socializing.For adults , lounge situated Thames floor ceiling windows take advantage beautiful views . Many rooms river views . Breakfast continental yogurt fruit addition croissants rolls , ham , cheese cereal , milk juice.A good hotel great amenities . entrance RER 1-2 minute walk , easy access areas London center location.I would compare hotel Radisson Marriott USA .
May 5 2009 Tired worn awful food travelled London see Tina Turner o2 looked trip advisor site booked . wish checked . hotel desperate need refurb although offered room upgrade compensate general grubby worn feel . bath dirty crack tub fixed tape ! ! ! room really odd aroma.On booking offered upgrade extra £30 included breakfast say worth . breakfast stone cold queried restaraunt manager advised someone turned heater food cabinet food cold . patently untrue stood next cheff brought called fresh food counter already cold indedible . Interestingly booked several people complaining breakfast well.As far accesssibility main attrractions , Thames Clipper Service five minutes walk river gives great access main attractions including 02 definitely best way get . going boat book return ticket 02 soon arrive avoid queing afterwards.My advice would find somewhere else stay definitely avoid hotel , wish .
May 4 2009 Checked Tripadviser FIRST ! ! ! start ? One worst hotels worst stayed long time . sorry n't check Trip Adviser booking would saved wife lot aggravation . Yes near O2 report favourably . rooms clean worn 10 years ago . asked front desk refurbished room given 819 . updated version - granny one legged circus performer . room stuffy , air conditioning n't work , bed squeaked moved little finger almost impossible get decent sleep . food n't worst feature level service poor . One staff - grumpy blonde East European would take half hour bring fresh tea table . ask manager us .

Everywhere grubby especially restaurant reminded us spanish 2 star inclusive food leaves lot desired , poor choice , kept luke warm long periodsand well presented . waiting staff , apart one , obviously found guests added hinderance duties eiher ignored . spoken backed away table though something important . Come Britannia pull socks embarassing think foreign visitors thought 4 star standard . Stay Premier Inn , far superior !
Apr 14 2009 Definately Four star ! wouldnt give One Star . Valentines Day partner decided book 'Four ' Star hotel previously staying Four Star Hilton month . amazing way ( Hilton Metropole - London ) .On arrival Lobby beautiful , reception staff ( day ) grumpy looked us scum . headed lifts small shabby .

Considering price star rating expected alot . Would better caravan . Location amazing shame put hotel , waste ........
Mar 31 2009 Great Hotel Fantastic Location stayed hotel twice fiance probably going later year . hotel lovely , nicely decorated , perfect bedrooms wonderful bar lounge overlooking river . Canary Wharf fab place stay outside city centre within easy travelling distance ( DLR tube ) . shopping centre great , variety shops prices ! hotel staff always helpful accommodating one actually joined us drink one evening ! stayed London quite times far best hotel 've stayed . n't put reviews outside hotel justice inside- gaurantee 'll love .
Mar 19 2009 Frequent visitor enough though 3rd time went say 'll try find another hotel next time.This hotel left time , refurbishment taken place years . main reason 've chosen many times location , business/stylish area , access newest underground line.However clean rooms , time left marks . ca n't expect room 284 GBP rate ( indicated reception ) kind facilities.Please bear mind stayed two different rooms , due short trip rooms bad condition.If expect Internet connection , take pair slippers , visit lounge room ( next reception ) connect wifi network . wire broandband connection , wifi , n't work properly.I admit hotel top classic decoration great view ( Thames branch river O2 ) , however , 'm sure whether find view mid 2009 , 2010 , new building built close east side hotel ( see www.ballymore.co.uk ) .Some photos horrible bathroom main room conditions , well great decoration view , : http : //img23.imageshack.us/img23/6274/britannia.jpgI almost forgot : get portable heater , heating set Alaska temperature levels .
Mar 1 2009 Good location great levels service Second time staying , mainly due price , availability going O2 . room ca n't comment food - apart say n't expect get hot drink 11:00pm - even cup hot chocolate possible apparently . Also - anyone allergic caffeine stuffed ca n't decaffeinated coffee - alternative offered herbal tea ! 's looking bit shabby days decoration bizarre - even normal hotel standards . 've selected would recommend friend - note suitable warning notices attached !
Feb 19 2009 Bloody awful shabby decor rude staff appalling food started going wrong check-in ; hard day work wanted collapse bed 10 minutes grabbing bite eat retiring evening work . arrived check-in chap started check process half way , without saying word disappeared never seen ! Eventually someone else picked process checked in.The decor shabby throughout , hotel motion sensitive lights corridors n't work properly leaving public areas semi-darkness ( safe feeling woman travelling alone London ) ; doors slam loudly make horrible racket.The decor rooms dreadful - taste , style - recommendation - leave curtains open focus view Canary Wharf window . n't even want think stain wallpaper room ! 's sound insulation hotel near Docklands Light Railway noisey trains.The bed uncomfortable squeaked loudly much twitch finger . shower mixer tap attachment - power , way thermostatic control , twiddle taps alternatively freezing scalding miserable dribble water.The 'complimentary ' coffee insult - 'm sure brand n't even think Lidl 's would stock it.As food - heavens sake n't eat ! 're surrounded area fabulous places eat n't one . shockingly poor quality ridiculously high prices.Theres Holiday Inn Express far less per night less pretentions - hotel know getting reasonable value money .
Feb 16 2009 Okay 'd call four star ! read mixed reviews Britannia International , little nervous 'd find stayed , overall 's perfectly acceptable hotel , though would n't rate four star.I found staff dealings nothing helpful , friendly knowledgeable.My standard room well-sized , plenty storage space ( triple wardrobe , trouser press inside , two beside chests drawers dressing table ) , three pint ( 1.7 litre ) kettle teapot appreciated , though latter would useful tea cosy provided well.Whilst room air conditioning , took time switch heating cooling turned on.I thought secondary & quot ; night light & quot ; bathroom good idea , though bathroom small , barely enough room washbasin , toilet bath.The corridors rather gloomy , carpets walls dark colours , doors , 's much lighting along them.The & quot ; double & quot ; bed comprised two , individually made , single beds pushed together beneath solid wooden headboard.Breakfast hit miss affair , single slice conveyor toaster appeared settings & quot ; charcoal & quot ; & quot ; warm bread & quot ; , nothing , n't eject toast far enough , fish around toaster pair tongs extract ... Though could problem output & quot ; tray & quot ; angled correctly.Tea coffee breakfast came jugs , left couple tables guests help . result , unless lucky enough get jug soon brought , tea almost invariably stewed.The windows room filthy , seemingly cleaned weeks , soundproofing minimal , noise pollution inside Hotel ( appeared Disco going night stayed ) outside ( Docklands Light Railway runs virtually behind building , 's one main roads area ) .In addition , use Hotel 's Health Leisure Club chargeable everyone , even Hotel guests , whereas majority similar Hotels 've stayed include use facilities part stay.Finally , 's price . time writing , rack rate Standard Twin Double room £105 ( room ) , rising £349 Penthouse Suite ( Breakfast Dinner ) , breakfast £10.50 per person Continental option , £13.50 per person Cooked option.In view , excessive overall quality Hotel , even allowing size rooms location , 'd unlikely stay Hotel n't promotional rate available .
Feb 5 2009 Made first trip London special . friends two kids decided going long weekend London summer hols . wanted go see Tutinkamoon exhibition , actually disappointed , another story.We decided travel train London easiest cheapest booked advance along hotel , London Eye tickets , King Tut exhibition Theatre tickets . wanted somewhere would easy get everywhere wanted really , thought best nearer Dome going first night n't want travelling around London first night far . picked Hotel . got great deal . family room double room.We found easy enough get Euston station via tube Hotel , advice buy tube pass either train Euston . n't pay son 10 , travelled free , recollect correctly may free hotel part deal.Anyway views gorgeous large family room , could see Millenium Dome lovely . room spacious beautifully decorated . Everything lovely . found staff helpful , advice etc.Breakfast everything could require set day , drink small snack required lunch time wasted restaurants day mention money . would good evening meal . would highly recommend hotel , especially something want see Millenium Dome . actually walked river Thames Greenich tunnel Thames know even existed caught boat trip Greenich got Tower Bridge . centrally located want central location hotels pay price . Also get tube 3 day pass travel underground rush hour unless pay higher price . intend get anywhere via tube centrally located would still wait . Strangely enough first morning daughter 's Geography teacher married English teacher came staying . Apparently go London every summer holidays new hotel would definately use .
Feb 3 2009 Old Shabby hotel let - booked part Superbreaks package Christmas present . ideally located travel around city London - expected rest place make fact , however disappointed.Parking available hotel reduction rate using staying hotel . £21 pretty pricey , takes £30+ taxi journey get anywhere couple changes tube ( ideal lone woman ) ! ! check gentleman nice enough although grasp English language put reception role.We given room adequate tired looking . bed atrocious , squeaked loudly much turn page book . walls thin cleaners noisy 7am.The second night ate hotel extremely average service level McDonalds . barman would circle service charge bill bought much cola bar.In summary - book hotel stay unless absolutely . plenty better located , better value places London .
Jan 30 2009 good deal impressed hotel , actually trying get something near Victoria , prices either rocketing high , quality trash . places looked really disgusting . decided International Hotel paid 60 Euros per night double room , hidden charges anything.Plus : closeness Canary Wharf tube - 15 minutes downtown . Price . Personal.Negatives : could n't open window almost diyed night , hot coulnd't turn heating ; personal bar rather helpful ; n't even bother paying 2,5 welness , 's disgusting reallly worth . guess UK people n't know use sauna pool . lot sweaty people jumped pool right left sauna - shower , like swmming sweat , 're welcome purchase ticket.Over , satisfied definitely would stay .
Jan 27 2009 Would NEVER go back ! ! stayed hotel group friends whilst london seeing show , therefore number rooms booked . Hotel rooms shabby looked like grandmas living room , although clean , one room damp corner another looked like blood spattered ceiling . one meal hotel , ate pizza place , service poor , food burnt , cold partially cooked , took half hour receive drinks complained , waitress extremely rude ! ! Hotel reception wasnt much help either . Overall , good experience !
Jan 26 2009 Good hotel great location read reviews site shortly day due arrive hotel , experienced little trepidation thinking might going . 'm pleased say problems hotel whatsoever enjoyable stay.First impressions hotel good location . hotel five minute walk Canary Wharf underground station ( cut buildings ) ten minute walk around quay ( 're unfamiliar shortcuts ) . lady served check-in polite friendly whole process took less two minutes . entering room , rather shabby-looking 1970 's room 'd led expect , found pleasant normal-looking hotel room . OK , maybe furniture , e.g . wardrobe , little worn wardrobe n't major part hotel stay ! room clean warm 's matters . room also air con , others , find room little warm points turning air con temperature seemed little effect . Kicking quilt worked fine though . thing would say single beds quite narrow . work ship 'm used times grab onto side bed stop rolling ! breakfast , never instead chose go nearby Starbucks . one evening meal Pizzeria admittedly n't impressed , much sister ate Canary Wharf mall point . pizza seemed pre-bought thing little flavour 200ml Coke ( smaller ) cost £2 ! ! ! n't use gym swimming pool , although intended , ca n't comment that.I found staff hotel polite friendly , also little surprised considering earlier reviews . observed one incident staff member rude guest whole stay ( although people would say one occurence one many ) .Overall though , 'd recommend hotel . 's location , taking fifteen twenty minutes get central London underground , really make great value money , especially get online offer ( 3 nights cost us £165 ) .
Jan 25 2009 Decent enough Stayed one night attending concert O2 Arena . Hotel overall nice room pleasant comfortable . Decent selection eateries hotel . Friendly staff . Good location getting O2 Arena - used hotel organised taxi .
Jan 25 2009 Old Britannia positive negative reviews essentials right ; hotel : 1 ) Relatively cheap -- get real bargain . corporate rate 138 GBP , far much . 2 ) Close tube station -- tube station ( Canary Wharf ) middle docklands . 're likely long ride away anything came see London . 3 ) Desperately need renovation . -- every single piece -- furniture tired chipped . television stands low podium ( see photo ) . two people sit bed watch tv , person right wo n't able see tv legs person left . desk chair wide gaps slats ( see photo ) woefully uncomfortable . bathroom clean , black stain bottom shower curtain fact soap dish looks like used ash tray . bathroom door lock missing cover screw ( photos ) . reported , double bed two single mattresses , disconcerting even sleeping alone . Bottom line : pay next nothing even really want stay Docklands .

Apr 4 2008 great - ca n't believe 's place described reviews returned yesterday business trip . n't choose hotel read reviews beforehand , horrified expected awful would probably need move hotels . could n't wrong . Maybe lucky got decent room ( 634 ) ? ... balanced review stay . Check-in swift ( although colleagues reported front desk slow confusion booking ) hassle-free . lobby hotel pretty grand - chandeliers , marble tables , vases stuff , bar views water.The room average size . clean , comfortable . decorated modern style , definitely dirty shabby faded . bathroom tiled/marble effect ; clean reasonable size . bed 2 single beds pushed together , although slept across n't problem divide ( done places beds pushed together ) . room hot , hot windows non-opening . aircon n't seem responsive , although , fair , n't try querying members staff . hate hot rooms ca n't generally sleep one , seem calm night like light , problem expected . room faced towards dome DLR tracks . could hear trains going past , n't particularly intrusive , ran less frequently night , certainly n't keep awake ( 'm good sleeper ) . Breakfast ( choose option ) served overlooking water . buffet extensive 've come across certainly adequate . Tea , coffee , cereals , breads , cold meats , cheeses , juices , fruit , selection cooked items . n't cooked items looked nicely cooked tempt . Check-out quick easy , paying parking.The hotel well located . 5 minutes ' walk gets Canary Wharf station , connects wider London transport network via Jubilee Line DLR . Despite fairly central busy area , quiet night.I went expecting bad , bad things pleasantly surprised . paid money gone pleasure rather business would also happy . n't know mine isolated happy experience , would like give comfort time reflect critical reviews . Hope helps !
Mar 14 2008 's Okay room little scary many haunting pictures hung wall . shower problem spend several minutes adjusting right temperature . A/C vent sometimes makes noise . fridge room tho.The goods location given room clean would give 2 stars , otherwise 1 star price .
Mar 3 2008 Go YMCA stayed business trip 5 days able get usual hotel . business travel department told may complaints problems hotel . hear saying well stay ? ? ? Well foolishly thought cant bad ... Canary Wharf must half decent . wrong was.Firstly problems checking concept charge everything back company account alien . spoken like 2 year old explained much allowed spend night - found quite rude . forced discuss room charging everytime ordered something got right .... eventually got upstairs , wanted sleep . walked room like walking Blackpool B & amp ; B . gaudy tired interior depressing TV . Four channels , 2 one channel 5 stuck frozen picture 2 days .... well didnt miss much come back anyway.The bed like sleeping park bench . springs completely gone single beds pushed together . forced sleep top bed , hope polyester quilt would soften bed made hair go static.I ordered breakfast read another review complete rip ... agree . back B & amp ; B breakfast tiny glass orange juice , 2 pieces toast fudge ( supposed fruit ) yoghurt , grand price £13.50 . Nice one . meals general bad , microwave rice , rock hard garlic bread , dirty looking chicken ... £3.00 half pint diet coke.The thing kept sane hotel pool . quite small - 4 strokes youre .... one way staying room . Please reading - go stay somewhere else ... someone needs shut hotel , start . old dirty lacks basics get newer cheaper hotel . Dont waste money .
Feb 26 2008 Nice hotel reasonable price reading trip advisor articles , expectations low l found hotel pleasant . l would rate 3.5star . rooms antique style decoration l like & amp ; location excellent getting central London without paying London prices . Canary Wharf new part London peaceful & amp ; safe intense crowds . l particularly thought gym best l seen hotel . free weights little old running equipment , pool , spa & amp ; layout gym big refreshing . staff lovely & amp ; chatty.l ordered hote chocolate & amp ; dessert room service loved hot chocolate came pot actually hot arrived room . l n't breakfast nicer walk Canary Wharf Square.My main negative shower room . l could get temperature right & amp ; water pressure weak . However , showers gym downstairs good .
Feb 24 2008 Horrid ! Britannia canary wharf seriously need decoration feels like last decorated 1950 , room awful came strong sewage smells . Need say ...
Feb 13 2008 Still hideous last misfortune stay Britannia almost 18 months ago thought ( naively perhaps ) varied numerous problems hotel would addressed . wrong was.Problems started check gentleman manning reception could work prepaid booking made avoid usual lengthy check check . Even beyond 15 minutes later call manager sort problem out.On plus side rooms clean . downside need redecoration old fittings , peeling wallpaper worn carpets . rooms also rather old fashioned plenty dark wood wonderfully kitch chandelier . Presumably height decorative opulence early 1980 's 's reminiscent Blackpool B & amp ; B 's trying hard.The bed akin sleeping cobblestones covered thin layer cloth . double bed actually made two mattresses additional pain hard ridge running middle bed . God forbid actually try roll night without running risk breaking spine . Added utter misery misfortune put room overlooking water . understand rooms command premium although 'm entirely sure view Docklands Light Railway building site worth extra cash . DLR runs early morning late night , noisy . sound proofing general non-existent . one point thought set Crossroads headboard wobbled room next door closed door . could also hear every grunt , groan splash neighbour 's early morning bowel movement.Even though stay company 's expense , refused pay absolutely extortionate £13.50 breakfast . would encourage hotel , especially profit margin n't seem going hotel itself.Please n't make mistake . positive outlook willingness forgive horribly abused Britannia International . Frankly , feel violated . 've stayed comfortable one man tents . Even though location convenient Canary Wharf , DLR stops within couple minutes walk Ibis , Novotel Marriot hotels . would n't hesitate choose Britannia .
Feb 4 2008 recommended Upon checking , offered upsell us expensive room complimentary breakfast ( rip 13.50GBP ) . went , found 11th floor room , enter room must climb spiral staircase get actual room . room huge London standards balcony . Unfortunately , first day lying bed getting jet lag , heard guy yelling phone , presumably nearby room , using obscene language . went time . Also , smell greasy cooking room ( 11th floor ! ) morning . breakfast fair , great . front desk unable even provide antacid returned evening , told us store open hour either . States , even basic hotels least sell roll antacid . would stay hotel , though liked area.If use calling card ( reasonable way make international calls ) dial ' 9 ' outside line , code listed card phone . dial ' 9 ' , wo n't charged toll-free call ; otherwise 's 2 quid .
Jan 25 2008 NEVER -- Would NEVER recommend stayed 6 nights weeks ago hotel . reason stayed hotel could accomdate parties budget division paying expenses . business trip funds coming global budget.Trust -- -none senior management would stay hotel voluntarily.Our problems started reception . girl checking us terrible communication skills took FOREVER . rate different agency quoted , time tired wanted rest dinner.It looks like may nice hotel 's day , needs serious refurbishing overhaul . Everything old , worn , saggy , peeling wallpaper , etc . overly decorated heavy , ornate , dusty fixtures , wallpaper , threadbare carpet . hallways dark , etc.The plus size room bathroom , generous . Oh , one plus 's location office , nice , walking distance.No alarm clocks , bed two twins pushed together sagging mattress . noisy night , loud noises coming room either side ( bathroom pipes , etc . ) .We finally escaped Hilton Canary Wharf , breath fresh air ! ! ! ! Beautiful hotel.Seriously , 140 pounds night hotel ashamed -- -spend updating ! ! !
Jan 4 2008 Musty ! Word ! well booked expedia , saw reviews last minute thought would risk , say reviews spot , place old musty . first impressions outside looked quite nice , inside completely different story ! Upon checking amazed amount brass ugly statues everywhere , reminded somewhere would grand thirty years ago passed sell date.We told booking could found system guy dealing us looked sounded like didnt want there.Room old decor- great view 02 dome canary wharf ! Lighting hallway came walked , felt like staying shining hotel . Dont stay help . Shame canary wharf really nice area nice shops locally good acesss jubillee line central london .
Dec 12 2007 Looks like good value 's smart-looking 4-star fifteen minutes central London half rates others ? n't misled : rates soft reason.The location 's OK 're business Docklands ( work firm tight travel policy ) otherwise would n't want . None traditional sights London within walking distance , taxi ride long tube crammed commuters day.The ironic thing half money England within mile place , sited heart London 's new business centre . decent product , hotel could charge whatever wanted . Yet Britannia suffers badly under-investment . bathrooms bedrooms old-fashioned things left Docklands whole place looking bit 1990s.Some investment need n't huge : much would cost clean lifts graffiti , replace bulbs 're gloomy ? several better hotels Docklands many appealing four-stars London . 'd stay elsewhere , even meant paying .
Nov 26 2007 Fine overnight stay following concert holiday ! booked hotel going concert O2 wanted hotel nearer O2 rather middle London.We n't disappointed location . hotel one stop away O2 walking distance Canary Wharf ( Jubilee Line ) South Quay ( DLR ) .Our room overlooked Canary Wharf water quiet well picturesque night.As late booking arrived found people booked n't notified hotel ! man serving us reception extremely helpful even upgraded two rooms booked moved adjoining kept us waiting ( n't long wait way ) ! friends made use one many comfy sofas reception area whilst waiting us check in.He absolutely fantastic wish 'd made note name could write management praising him.As arrived concert doors opened n't time eat , visit bar use pool ca n't comment them.Our rooms fine size wise , however decorated furnished old fashioned style using faux antiques ... ? ? hotel middle modern part London n't make interior modern ? ? beds comfy ( room 710 ) perfect nights sleep room clean tidy . Even though 1 pillow bed , usual , extra ones wardrobe.The heating room worked well plenty warm enough us returned concert.The bathroom , however , let though . clean shower bath functioned well hot water , craked wall tiles near floor opposite toilet felt bit old need replacement.We left next morning without breakfast n't want pay £13.50 ! paid £99 room n't think bad room London short notice , would dissatisfied hotel paid more.The Britannia International exactly wanted somewhere shower put heads night.I would book hotel want somewhere stay concert O2 's perfect , 're going holiday London really would stay somewhere else 's neither tourist area hotel would want spend lot time .
Nov 18 2007 One night enough stayed International 6 years ago due location booked weekend break recently . one stop O2 perfect concert break . However , expected decor changed dated last visisted ! beds uncomfortable springs coming , walls paper thin even card entry system giving ( took us 3 card changes porter forcing door open get room - want checking ) .The bar convenient reasonably priced although beer flat wine choice poor .
Nov 10 2007 tired stay hotel regularly company book . paying 'd stay else . clean enough hotel tired worn edges . staff helpfull enough . Food wise Jennys carvery good deal nice selection.If get £100 good deal advertised price high . towels smell vinegar TVs fuzzy pictures 6 channels.Over fine night 2 business .

Oct 28 2007 Location top overall average second visit Britannia International hotel , time spur-of-the-moment thing.Did n't think parking , intending park Byng Street ( 30 sec walk away restriction parking weekend ) . limited underground parking , £15 overnight , somewhat except city , except expires 9am 3 quid hour . Check-in problem . Like reviewers , problem room card key , guests resorted calling staff member help . first visit fortunate get river / Canary Whalf view , extremely attractive feature hotel , disappointingly time facing street side . sure , 'd certainly recommend asking river view . Room nice warming feeling usual facilities , TV channels limited - Ch1-5 , Sky News , something else.There free wireless Internet , bonus 've brought wireless device.Choice three restaurants , nice lounge area nice settees overlooking river . leisure facilities on-site , n't use look them.Rather disappointing experience breakfast next morning . Room wanted pay breakfast extra . Went main breakfast restaurant , asked wanted Continental Full English . Opted Continental , redirected restaurant next door . basically two choice cereals - Rice Crispies Corn Flakes , basket bread , Tea/Coffee . available tables cups , could n't get Tea/Coffee . Waiters wandering around actually helping . thought sod , went back next door upgrade Full English explain problem . told could Continental room alongside Full English ( could n't first place , n't know ) . full selection Continental items 'd expect ! feel tried fob cheap lousy service.What love hotel : - Location . Perfect exploring Canary Whalf area . DLR station road . Safe feeling area.- view , get it.- free Internet access gets vote.- free papers , magazines , journals scattered around.What hate hotel : - Nothing really ! One two disappointments , nothing complain .
Oct 25 2007 Would never stayed money stayed hotel Sep 07 highly convenient location work Canary Wharf . £160 night double room 's poor value money though.Bad : bed comfortable . Spongey mattress , flat pillows . LOUD LOUD LOUD . 've got room facing DLR groaned creaked loudly night early morning . Impossible ignore . time asked quiet room , got one facing away DLR , however , noise high volume air-conditioning roof building really really loud . mean , checked 6 times window wasnt open . Traffic noise also came strongly . 'd brought earplugs case , werent . Telly 5 channels wasnt tuned setup well . safe room . Found staggering . Valuables ( eg . passports ) would stored reception , people noted , staff arent exactly snappy 'd quite pain check-in stuff time . Keycard door worked 1 15 swipes . went got new one , bad . Check-in seemed take eternity , several going backroom . checking , another couple gentleman also seemed difficulties rooms reserved work , staff couldnt seem find reservation.Good : curtains black-out least dark loud . room clean , little worn . Facilities like ironing , trouser press present . Convenient Canada Square/Canary Wharf , actually longer walk think walk quite way get bridge . Staff didnt seem rude , people said , bit slow/inefficient.As room paid fine , couldnt stay ridiculously noisy .
Oct 5 2007 bad expected great either ... company booked hotels 3 nights month ( October ) . reading reviews , prepared worst . Maybe 's views hotel n't strong . Indeed , although problems , still n't think awful . Maybe 's also could claim money back expenses ... First , let tell much business hotel , suitable tourists mainly location middle office buildings . unless 're going concert Millennium dome ( O2 Arena 's called days ) . 's 1 stop DLR 1 stop tube ( Jubilee line North Greenwich ) .I checked 2pm pretty quick . Reception staff polite ( time round anyway ) . Came room big ( London anyway ) fairly clean . TV 's got usual terrestrial channels plus Sky sports , Sky news ITV3 . Bathroom fine size powerful enough shower . thing n't like bed really uncomfortable : could feel every spring lying mattress , pillows hard brick ! Anyway , later checked bill . turned hard charged first day nights , charged £455 instead £315 . went back reception refunded £140 difference . wished 'd apologized go . Lucky noticed , 's quite big difference cost.I meals hotel , simply time year gets dark early long days work n't feel like going . choices around hotel quite poor well . Even though 're 10mins walk Canary Wharf , either sandwich places shops , restaurants expensive.So first evening dinner French-style restaurant . food ok , even though restaurant half-empty wait nearly hour half served bit chicken cherry tomatoes ! well bored , hungry ate everything eat : 2 small breads butter side plate ! people restaurant complained well . soon finished eating left table asked pay go . 's finally got apology.There two restaurants hotel . buffet one fine price ( plus 's buffet n't wait eat ) , Italian-style one really n't serve nice food . room service well . especially one thing inedible : garlic bread seemed like burnt , hard oily pizza base ... Anyway , 's bad experiences , apart able get back room 's 've got push key cards right opening door . colleague mine though TV n't work , reception told go watch TV lobby really n't acceptable ... Facilities hotel also include bars , pool table , gym indoor swimming pool . gym pool basement . pool 's fairly small shallow , 's relaxing swimming . gym 's got bicycles running machines , nothing special better nothing like looking shape . guess 's hotel 's got stars , also probably imposing entrance makes look better really is.Looking back review , really seems like awful hotel , really n't feel like stay ruined n't expect moon business hotel area . would say 's average , far worst hotel world ...
Oct 4 2007 Think long hard stayed Britannia close O2 , went saw gig . arriving hotel told booking name , suddenly found 5 mins later . friends arrived lucky ! ! told - room . ended book different hotel , even though room confirmation email . hotel interested . asked speak manager no-one came . told wait - 1hr later one come told hotel fully booked room . requested non-smoking room , got smoking room ashtray removed . stank smoke , point requested bedding changed.The rooms general decor looked tired , woken 07.30am room service even though & quot ; disturb & quot ; sign hanging door.The LDR ( London docklands railway ) situated 1/2 mile away trundling past every 20mins around 06.30am . Made quiet noise .
Sep 24 2007 n't waste money Britannia International Docklands LondonTerrible , Terrible , Terrible . would waste money.Just let say late July late Sept.It business area . person would think hotel would try accommodating long term guest . big group one problems . would say 98 percent people problems.They promised group lot n't follow though . example : new comfortable beds . got beds might well sleeping concrete slab.Refrigerators also promised group yet never received.It took 3 hours get checked . rooms dated wall paper falling walls.The water pressure rooms poor best ( water pressure hard time keeping shower valve ) change room . lucky change even times room could live with.The Staff helpful . sure n't seem like wanted . let alone enjoyed work . one occasion , left room go & amp ; placed 'please service room ' placard door handle . returned little later , placard turned around show 'do disturb ' side . Apparently , rather actually service room , maid service flipped sign around ! gettting change front desk became onerous task . Regardless small currency offered , front desk clerk ALWAYS go back . wasting time looking cash drawer front , seeming stall looking confused . hard change 20 pound note smaller bills ? want drink bar line 5 , prepared wait least 15 minutes.In London smoke enclosed space ( 's cool ) step outside smoke outdoor patio , bartender tell manager manager ( Jason ) call police . police came gave manager dirty look smiled us left . course visit , constantly harassed going smoke . ridiculous ! Everyday something else.If say staying Britannia International Docklands London ... Don't.Its friendly place .
Sep 24 2007 Worst Hotel Earth Food terrible , service non-existant , front desk people could speak english nobody seemed idea reservations.It took 12 hours ( joke ) get room sorted key would work . Hotel staff right hostlie . group 50 people several people sick breakfast.Room running hot water staff seemed unconcerned this.I travel living world worst ever experienced.Stay away !
Sep 23 2007 Enjoyable stay ! Fabulous location , decent service room luxuryBest part lovely view window . Enjoyed stay !
Sep 23 2007 Average Stayed three nights September.Rooms bit musty ( ca n't open windows ) dated decor spacious enough may require e.g . tea/coffee , iron , tv , AC , etc .. Location good ( five minutes Jubilee line Canary Wharf , DLR Bank ) .Would n't first choice next time would n't like paid rack rate .
Sep 20 2007 Poor quality attitude stayed hotel visit play West End visit Billingsgate next morning . experience expected.As noted reviewers , staff friendly service rather slow ; particular staff trying avoid customers queue . room got alright , hower , difficult book wake-up call . advertised number work , reception answer switch-board grumpy.The first surprise , hotel bar closes 15 minutes guests wait get something drink ; quite unique never experienced . next one hotel ran nibbles Friday evening ; bar nothing sent us room service - room-service n't anything complained bar sending guests . Finally , hotel concierge know hotel pool - ask colleague whether one find it.When arrived back home , sent letter ( paper email ) Britannia complaining service hotel . Foolishly , expected reply ; justification , apology least acknowledgement . far , heard nothing expect future . final straw avoid group whenever possible .
Sep 11 2007 great location husband stayed Britannina International Hotel London September one night . location 5minute tube journey O2 Arena went see Prince concert . flew Heathrow hoped tube hotel . hotel located 5min walk Canary Warf tube station docklands . 4 star hotel , old style decore , staff friendly.It bar , restaurant niteclub get chance try .

Aug 7 2007 average stayed times spend bit time Canary Wharf work . hotel lobby gives reasonable impression , fooled . stayed 5 different times company work top list ( £80 - £100 night roughly ) . rooms dated . Chinz order day . Flaking gold taps , tiles 80 's , pattern wall paper , none particularly well maintained . shower moring either froze death , caused skin blister . Move tap millimeter suffer !

English breakfast could help , could much like . alot choice , , even boiled egg ! Breakfast room nice reasonably comfortable . much enjoyed stay n't want leave !
Jul 26 2007 Worth cheap deals .. stayed bargin rates - working Canary Wharf better average Holiday Inn Express Ibis hotel.It 's getting little shaby however rooms tired - rooms great views staff seem happy move better room can.I n't rate food however quite often hotel full confused tour groups / conference delegates.Full rate complete rip - looks specials worth !
Jul 24 2007 Average 70 pounds double room 's bad . could better though . Dated room , uncomfortable bed , quite far central London . Plus points- excellent view Wharf , big room , minutes nearest tube station .
Jul 19 2007 missed opportunity 've stayed Britannia twice . first room reasonable size dark bathroom needed refurbishment . latest stay huge room views water , Canary Wharf Millenium dome . decor fairly old-fashioned - think aim Victorian look . room public areas clean . bed two singles pushed together cheap uncomfortable mattress although bathroom better condition sink plug would n't stay closed getting shower temperature right took . Although included room cost , n't bother breakfast time . restaurant fantastic views water food unappealing jugs used tea / coffee n't seem kept separate , get tea tastes coffee . decent sized kettle room together coffee sachets , teabags biscuits . overall feeling hotel missing great opportunity - c , ean , good sized rooms great location close DLR station 10 minutes walkway Canary Wharf shops restaurants . let poor food , poor mattress dirty windows spoiling great views . looks like another hotel built close think Britannia may lose custom .
Jun 18 2007 Yep get pay ... Booked one night lastminute.com 'executive double ' ( know n't get - definitely standard ) . Fairly good first impressions - rather old fashioned warm welcoming . Staff completely unremarkable although efficient . room , well ... old fashioned say least , clean . Clean sheets towels generally tidy - problems respect . thing 'd say windows outside grubby , obscuring view . However attributed massive building site right outside window ... admit , weekend n't much noise building site , may different story throughout week . n't quietest room world hot . fans noisy throughout night n't seem awful lot anyway ... spent much night fighting bedclothes attempting cool ! shower rather appalling - much hot/cold/hot/cold ... pressure bad . Oh hairdryer n't work ... main thing irritated place someone bursting room 7:30am Sunday morning . Admittedly n't 'Do Disturb ' sign door , n't customary knock first anyway ? ? Certainly great move part.Anyway , despite everything , actually fairly enjoyable time . nothing hotel 'wowed ' boyfriend , particularly impressed , clean , tidy , anonymous great location . Exactly hoping .
Jun 16 2007 get pay Staff service good , hotel clean . mattress must older hotel , though , padding springs . Hot water available -- -if took shower 8am . 8am , hot water tap produced air intermittent spits hot water . colleagues similar reports mattresses hot water .
Jun 3 2007 Great hotel - HUGE room good service stayed hotel bank holiday weekend honestly say wonderful time . jaw almost hit ground saw big bedroom bed comfortable even though two singles pushed together . addition , view 6th floor spectacular.My major concern going swanky appartment block built right next door ) going lot building noise soon b ) probably block view across Thames Millennium Dome . unlikely stay unfortunately.I ca n't comment food room only.The location hotel excellent - hundred metres nearest DLR station .
Jun 2 2007 Good Hotel good business travelers , internet work hotel rooms .
May 31 2007 Terrible hotel price stay somewhere else ! ! travelled Canary Whary regularly couple years stayed one night Britannia never ! rate GBP 130 & quot ; executive room & quot ; . arrival informed , despite booking room , executive style rooms left . given room described awful . Tiny , outdated single bed scratchy woolen bed cover . hotel right beside DLR line , addition awful room put great deal noise passing trains . reduction room rate checked extremely dissapointing given box put in.Breakfast free . Little staff coordination instead normal tables , guests expected sit galley style benchs afford little privacy pretty uncomfortable hotel busy . Food poor.The good thing say hotel location . knowledge mid price hotel Canary Wharf area Marriott , Hilton Four Seasons top end . said , stay locally , take Hilton Docklands across river , although good , much better joint . Better still stay one hotels river take clipper tube Canary Wharf .
May 28 2007 Cheap stayed one night , cost around £70 . set rate far higher ( ludicrous - n't expect anyone pays ) .The hotel rather old-fashioned , extremely naff decor ( tonnes chinz , gaudy chandeliers etc ) . n't go expecting styish stay , 's OK price.The staff , one notable exception , sullen uncooperative . Checking pain . 've seen worse , 'd expect better , even low price.The room ugly rest hotel , fairly small . double bed clearly two singles pushed together , big ridge middle . clean , though , bathroom . shower bit crummy , work.Breakfast best avioded - 's free-for-all buffet ( get tea coffee , example , help thermos-jug counter ) . tables n't set properly.We n't use basement pool , look - 's fairly small , looks OK.Overall - need somewhere stay lowish price , hotel OK - make sure n't pay standard rate , ridiculous . want good hotel , 's Hilton road .
May 21 2007 's OK ... nothing special ... bad hotel 10 days business . stayed three different rooms pretty good idea hotel . told n't get internet 2nd , 3rd , 4th & amp ; 5th floors inconvenience . needed internet moved 8th floor . rooms standard small size , nice view canary wharf staff accommodating requests . even hooked us room service late night even kitchen closed nice.I spent couple nights two rooms two small beds . honest think smallest bed ever slept entire life . rolled would fall . ( fact fall bed ... joke ) . bed 5th floor comfortable , one 8th floor comfortable , fairly hit miss.The last nights suite upper floor . OK room nice , big great bath room , dining/desk area large comfortable bed . pretty happy whole time room .. bathroom majorly upgraded jacuzzi tube ect.Food : buffet good offered wide variety & quot ; english & quot ; food . enjoyed meals lot .... fact gained 5 pounds 10 days . LOL.It convenient Canary Wharf business district really would want tourist.If could make one suggestion owners hotel , would tell need quit pushing two small beds together make one big bed . get big mattress . makes HUGE difference comfort . Overall regrets staying , would happily . bad place certainly nothing special.I done lot travel though England n't lot compare property , take account reading review .
May 21 2007 Fine get bargain rate outside looks like 70 's concrete block . inside 's chintz ornaments bit odd . confusion checking ( 'd booked twin room given double ; next room given already occupied ) upgraded consequently got bigger room anticipated . Room fine although curtains n't exactly keep daylight one bed squeaked awful lot . bathroom nice though good shower/bath . 'd got last minute bargain rate though perfectly happy value money . Great location need Canary Wharf etc handy anywhere DLR route including Greenwich .
Apr 30 2007 Fine Like previous reviewers found hotel nowhere near bad described . Lounge areas comfortable , bedrooms ( standard ones ) little dated ( yes also problems 'key ' ) clean quite comfortable ; staff generally pleasant aswell . Carvery Jenny 's pretty average , one night pizza pizzeria fine . Probably worth paying £75 night get cheaper 's well worth .
Apr 22 2007 problem Booked AIRMILES & amp ; n't bad deal yet nearly cried read reviews . However ready battle arrived hotelAt 9pm , timed & amp ; , took 10 minutes greeted foyer getting room - 'm unhappy & amp ; check 10.30am.The room good size extra pillows & amp ; blankets wardrobe . complaint luggage stand . hate putting cases bed , idea dragged way ! Decor good & amp ; bedroom & amp ; bathroom clean.In cold light day wallpaper & amp ; skirting boards little scuffed ( shame former occupants n't informed Housekeeping measures taken remedy faults ! ) bed linen & amp ; towels pristine . air conditioning worked OK figured out.We DLR view room bit noisy n't bother us first night & amp ; great close public transport . Continental Breakfast included booking , upgrade Full English £5.50 thought bit much available . Nobody actually checked taking though . first morning many tables uncleared arrived breakfast asked could table cleared next window & amp ; done straight away . Breakfast n't Hilton Le Meridion standards OK get past lunch time . signs tea coffee , help ( coffee blue thermos flasks , tea white ) ask staff bring fresh . breakfast buffet seem little understaffed n't pay lot room ca n't expect hotel overstaff restaurant . Conservatory Bar great place drink end day & amp ; staff friendly . Drinks n't seem overly priced either.The room keycards seem little 'eccentric ' asked reception nice lady came straight away get us sorted . jiggled card , twiddled door handle & amp ; muddled through.Think read showers - well first morning got bath taps running , temperature OK etc , switched shower , shower head jumped stand & amp ; soaked & amp ; quite bit bathroom . Second day - us never learn ! Third morning took bath.We real problems , nowhere London quiet . staff friendly & amp ; helpful & amp ; even though hotel undergoing refurbishment & amp ; full really great place stay .

However , found aspects well satisfactory . Reception downstairs bar/setting areas look right onto docks give impression 4 star facility . room ( entered key card ) 5th floor Victorian decor keeping rest hotel , generally good condition although bits approaching re-furbishing time ( carpets bit worn etc ) .Did complained air-con hot , maintenance man suddenly appeared opened locked window , seemed trick . Breakfast adequate buffet , although told qualified cold continental , ignored . Finally best aspect Hotel location , right South Quay dock , nearby footbridge takes Canary Wharf , skyscrapers , bars , underground shops , tube DLR ready take old London town .
Feb 23 2007 Simply rubbish hotel review someone stayed 20 times . reason convenient location Canary Wharf ( office time ) . said , often decided stay much away office avoid it.The hotel , renovated , could Ok .

Dec 15 2006 Mediocre least A/C stayed client meetings Canary Wharf 2 days , thought would convenient . , stay pretty mediocre , sure worth it.The hotel swarmed guests arrived , waited 30 minutes line get checked in.My room large , old carpet , worn sheets/comforter , furniture good 30 years old.On positive side , got good rate ( think due location ) , pizza restaurant made good pizza dinner . Otherwise kind disappointment.Also , stayed August hot , thankful A/C . guess counts something ...
Dec 11 2006 poor experience Stayed commencing 20th October 200625minutes get checked , electronic guest room door keys function , therefore return reception 20 minute wait , leaving family waiting corridor.Many staff surly attitude , waiting staff appeared lacking personal hygiene , 'not pleasant experience one eats hotels restaurant'.Some bedroom bathroom fittings broken , poorly maintained shower head resulted flooded bathroom floor.We became aware swimming pool order went use confronted handwritten note hanging stairs , explaining use would time.I advise friends family consider hotel , advertised time four star hotel , stayed far better three star hotels .
Nov 27 2006 Complete disaster n't bother booking . Hotel overbooks routinely meaning pre-paid room counts nothing . Service appalling . Failed offer satisfactory alternative accommodation . Disgrutled customers fight bar . opinion , avoid costs . advised ......

Refurbishment option place , benefit customer . 's brand new Hilton along road place , 'll probably using future ( 'm sure wo n't woken constant rumbling DLR trains ) .

Oct 30 2006 stuck Room : supposed ready 2pm requested non smoking room case . room dated gave impression n't clean . double room consisted two single beds pushed together . Keycard work properly involved numerous visits reception.All reception staff appeared trainees . Breakfast poor , fruit canned fruit & quot ; English breakfast & quot ; looks terrible.I stayed business purposes short distance London City airport 5 minute walk Canary Wharf . good thing hotel .

Aug 17 2006 Best value London good hotel booked hotel back ( got good deal Britannia hotels website ) , reading reviews site rather worried stay seem lots negative comments left hotel.I returned 3 day stay Britannia International honestly could find fault hotel 's staff . hotel claims 4 star , truth probably like 3 star get cheap deal website hotel offers fantastic value money . room 12th floor ( top ) lovely views Canary Wharf towers . room large ( compared central London hotels ) , large bathroom comfortable bed . decor room fine , may cutting edge design room practical perfectly clean , rest hotel might add.The meals taken hotel breakfast , fine lots choice offer . staff spoke helpful , friendly efficient . opinion hotel great location far enough away central London get away crowds yet within easy reach . Canary Wharf tube station ( Jubilee line ) South Quay DLR station within minutes walk central London 20 minutes . Canary Wharf area also lots offer large underground shopping mall good selection bars & amp ; restaurants nearby.To honest n't think hotel deserves low rating , assume travellers bad experiences . think hotel excellent value money would recommend anyone looking good value London hotel
Aug 17 2006 Worst hotel catalogue problems dealing hotel say strongly enough no-one ever enter hotel let alone pay money stay it.I got married 5 August 2006 hotel booked husband first night . negotiated discounted rate relatives flying wedding hopeful rooms service would top notch .

Jul 19 2006 n't stay ... Without doubt hotel worst service ever experienced.On arrival 4.05 pm 2 colleagues informed rooms cancelled resold n't arrived 4pm . Nowhere documentation state requirement . receptionists gormless extreme finally calling duty manager made Basil Fawlty seem like reasonable person . explained n't hotel 's responsability would try find alternative accomadation us basically tough.Eventaully 2 half hours arrived , managed secure twin triple room shared . something work hard achieve duty manager insisted rooms available 'twin rooms get let tour groups ' n't check talked us said standard hotel practice - travelled around World confirm 'normal ' hotel cancel booking customer n't arrived 4pm , especially without giving customer warning might that.The rooms hot ( aircon ineffective ) , dirty small.The bad service continued concierge sending us completely wrong direction 'nearby restaurant ' room service turning breakfast order 6.45am requested demand cash breakfast . roomservice argued us could n't put bill oto room ( even though credit card number ) proceeded barge room pick telephone talk reception handing phone us saying would need speak them.I honestly never stayed anywhere terrible service would implore anyone thinking might good place stay think . 's terrible place need renovations without slightest understanding customer service . n't stay .
Jul 16 2006 Awful stay stayed Britannia International one week June working Canary Wharf hotels available area . terrible stay . mattress bed incredibly uncomfortable - think could feel every spring . overall room decor incredibly ugly ( must least 6 clashing patterns ) . clocks rooms wake-up call service work two days . staff helpful explained problem . hotel generally shabby uncomfortable . food service well would expect supposedly 4 star hotel . gym small , old equipment , included price room . evacuation fire hotel ( yes real fire ! ) opportunity speak guests complained air conditioning working rooms ( heat wave London ) amongst problems . recommended . since stayed hotel Central London unable find accomodations better hotels Canary Wharf .

Jun 19 2006 disappointing wife due stay hotel three nights checked one.The reception staff spoke limited english seem able handle vast amount tour groups stay here.The room spacious fantastic vies Canary Wharf . marred delapidated state furnishings including mattress old springs poking back . tried make outside phone call could n't . front desk informed us needed set account . complaining convincing tham given credit card details check thay gave us outside line.We parked car underground parking garage told 15 pounds 24 hours . two hours take car go shopping . front desk told pay parking two hours 2 ponds per hour could take car . made sense , go times 24 hours could end costing 48 pounds total . complained manager directly 15 minutes heated conversation front desk gave ticket saying would charged ! 5 pounds total . even tried make favour.I think sad way hotel like promote fact 4 star 2 star best.This hotel fell far expectations.We return hotel .
Jun 8 2006 Horrible stayed June conference therefore choice take offer accomodation . However , describe hotel 'hell hole ' serious need update . hotel might state art early 90 's past sell date ! ! room shabby , outdated musty . net curtains ( yes net curtains ! ! ) holes , carpet threadbare places decor 'chintzy ' . awoken early constant sounds DLR rattled past window well man shouting swearing top voice 6am morning ( warned walls thin ! ! ) Breakfast also dissapointment despite sign indicating guests wait seated , several staff completely ignored waited reception desk one even stood next swearing loudly could unlock store cupbard . end walked table even offered option tea/coffee ! ! Whilst choice continental full english average.Like rooms , lunch evening meals also dubious dishes tasted like re-heated several times . result came home rather upset stomach ! plus side ( one plus ! ) rooms rather large spacious really compensate rest hotel.In terms location , would choose stay Canary Wharf unless business would certainly never go back Britannia . area busy weekdays plenty bars nice sit outside summer deserted weekends therefore recommended tourists .
May 28 2006 Great value internet price Went internet get directions hotel accidently came upon Trip Advisor . Read reviews mostly appalling hotel somewhat apprehensive stay . time late cancel internet booking expecting worst . pleasant surprise , staff extremely friendly helpful , room clean breakfast ( food consumed ) absolutely fine.The thing agree hotel could uplift slightly dated.I n't qualms staying !
May 25 2006 Rude Staff Stale Rooms Poor Food - could ask looking cheaper alternative business travel canary wharf . place solution . 6 weeks staying 3 nights week could n't take . Absolutely consistent- rude staff- iron room ( business travel ! ) - terrible food- non smoking rooms smell like astray- bed covers must never washed- v slow check / check out- painful decor- points program frequent guests ( main reason 'm going back ! ) fair - couple plus points- FREE wireless internet access ( first UK hotels ? ) - good location wharf ( 10 mins main block ) - small fitness room pool . ( pay extra )
May 23 2006 Kitch rude decorator hotel fired , personel manager . room caused severe degree visual indigestion ever encountered . hugely mismatched floral fabrics , torn , discoloured lace curtains , red blue patterened carpet , long over-used quilted beadspreads , gold red armchairs ... best keep sunglasses . Staff acted through-out trapped policy support . Upon check-inn mention extras settled cash . minibar room , ordered bottle water room-service . arrived half hour later settled cash . Served mediocre breakfast buffet , leaving restaurant , asked told settle cash . reservation made one month advance Gold Card ... upon arrival midnight long flight , front office manager could retrieve booking depite holding copy email confirming reservation ... overall , gave hotel four stars ?
May 18 2006 's got alternatives ... would like echo thoughts reviewers - hotel 4 star standard . hotel tired dated , & quot ; red carpet & quot ; outside hotel , feels like staff entrance rather guest main entrance ! service slow checking , tried charge full rate even though booked cheaper rate internet Euro 75.The rooms tidy furnishings tired . bathrooms reasonable size n't expect quality bathrooms products . use hotel facilities comment . upside , hotel well located Canary Wharf main reason chose stay price . hotel also close Canary Wharf underground station . said , need stay Canary Wharf , definitely find better value money options elsewhere town , & quot ; feel good & quot ; factor .
May 13 2006 even 1 Star hotel rated 4 star n't . Rooms horrible , old fashion , basic cold ! ! Staff rude Manager advised wirte Head Office resolution .. Wrote Head office , Manager responded regurgetated letter reply said sorry , resolution offered , n't happy . STAY HOTEL ! ! poor quality priced . Travelodge Liverpool street far better one 3 star much cheaper ! !
May 2 2006 even worth 1 star chose hotel part business dinner , based star rating location central London . shocked were.The hotel 10-minute walk Canary Wharf many bars shops , well 5 minute walk South Quay Docklands Light Railway Station , links City rest Docklands area.Even though 's 4-star hotel , decor bulding incredibly dated . maybe 4-star 20 years ago , room dirty , furnishings thrown years ago.On arrival staff , though efficient , n't polite . headed use pool experience . pool area dirty , changing areas looked though n't cleaned weeks help get key use locker . leave valuables side pool . floor sauna also littered rubbish . Disgusting.The rest hotel could best described okay . room first floor dinner good views Docklands service staff pleasant enough . bar area afterwards lacked sofas seats - many people standing.Give miss . n't even worth one star .
May 1 2006 stayed one night would recommend hotel easy find tube station also located near shopping centre . bedroom window could see Millenium Dome ! ! read people 's reviews hotel use pool eat restaurant comment facilities looking hotel impress one .
Apr 25 2006 Average hotel - Good location Docklands Stayed one night london marathon.Pre-booked room discount website - check-in fast efficient.Room large - looked like re-furbished recently bathroom certainly n't redecorated . Everything worked apart Air Con rubbish ( number reviews stated ) eat restaurant point blank refuse spend £14 breakfast.Location good , 5 minute walk Herons Quay DLR station - nice views London.Fast , efficient checkout concierge service look bags ( charged £1 per item per day ) conclusion - decent hotel looking docklands based trip .
Apr 24 2006 Would return Britannia International husband booked hotel treat first wedding anniversary , paper hotel seems nice - especially 's location , practice complete let . hotel reception area nice true reflection rest hotel . rooms basic - could find luxury Travel Lodge - view bedroom window exceptional . staff spoke extremely basic English really akward asking general questions hotel facilities directions - also really unhelpful . taken us vintage bottle champagne wanted drink room actual wedding anniversary - begrudged us two champagne glasses . weekend also hidden charges n't allowed take towels room pool instead pay hire towels pool area , something never heard . pool area mould ceiling wires hanging neither pleasant safe 'grunted ' asked change lockers . Breakfast fiasco . Usually given instruction sit help buffett . recieved neither made sit dirty table expected use rest pot tea left people us - made well aware inconvieniance causing asking fresh one . final straw arrived asked night one hour extention check time - surprisingly granted receptionist try charge us extra hour nobody written extention given . one saving grace weekend location hotel - Canary Wharf fantastic place fantastic shopping/restaurants etc also really easy get central london - visit Wharf must . However , would n't recommend stay Brittania International Hotel due exceptionally poor service accomodation much need face lift .
Apr 4 2006 get better deal London Britannia International Hotel offers jacuzzi rooms , carvery restaurant , hotel bar , car parking , swimming pool , gym cool canary wharf location.Anyone gives hotel less 4 stars never travelled .

Mar 12 2006 Unfortunately say good things Britannia International returned London stayed three nights Park Lane Hotel Piccadilly four nights Britannia International Canary Wharf . Whereas Park Lane Hotel nice , say Britannia.To short point , shall mention things need fixed:1 . dinning room serves breakfast ( Jenny 's ) far clean . plates glasses plain filthy cutlery . wanted take egg cup soft boiled egg one clean one . also noticed staff set tables , holding cups thumb cup forks tip fork instead handle . floor outright dirty . Service non-existent . call several times passing staffer bring us coffee . Yet , several staff members/waiters standing around nothing . food buffet arranged nicely attractive . One evening , dinner restaurant even service awful dirty.2 . room decor unattractive , staff 's fault . fault , room stuffy ventilation work properly bathroom sink clogged . asked housekeeping fix two things , nothing done . , solve air problem wanted open window . order open close windows , one call concierge , . left room came back much later find rained somebody housekeeping drawn curtain open window , nobody actually closed , got wet around window.3 . two phone messages , important . message light blinking , way knowing messages waiting . many hours later ( one actually next morning ) , receive phone call messages . service excuse it.4 . found front desk staff polite completely nonchalant . asked wether could check one hour later told would charge us BP10 . , way attract hotel guests come back.I see Britannia Hotels trying hard improve Internet bookings . May rather look improving hotels , least one.I , never recommend anyone stay hotel experience , doubt even want try another Britannia Hotel .

Te experience pretty bland , room ok ( although two twin beds pushed together double ) , service ok ( nobody helped bags room n't ready even though arrived advertised check time ) .We ordered breakfast delivered room ( 26 miles run wanted bit substinance ) . n't arrive get something eat way , although still managed charge us breakfast ! whole , got cheap price OK stay .

Oct 9 2005 worst hotel experience pulled taxi saw three men , appeared work hotel , standing around talking . none came help bags assumed n't hotel staff . Silly . checked . Still mention anyone help bags , lumbered room . level service described introduction Britannia turned utterly representative rest experience . first morning , receive requested wake-up call . One night came back hotel 11:15pm . needed quick meal get bed . tried phone room service could n't get . finally phoned front desk said would get phone . 10 minutes later gave waiting couple tries got room service . never got message . ordered turkey cranberry sandwich - seemed like least offensive option extremely limited sandwich-only menu . arrived 45 minutes later , turned disgusting food ever served hotel . Without shred exageration , bread stale , turkey represented thin slice processed turkey food product , trace cranberry ( hope flavor sandwich ) , , worst , lettuce completely limp , places actually black slimy rot - kind thing anyone else would thrown away days ago . utterly insulting served sandwich . complained , holding piece limp rotten lettuce , room service waiter said 'That 's Britannia ' . Straight horse 's mouth . replacement sandwich - hold lettuce - much better managed get putting bed shortly 1:00am . epilogue story equally unreal . left room service tray room . Housekeeping removed placed hallway , remained . got back room 10:00pm next night , peeked head door midnight . credit , gone morning , . got cab driver figured going airport . , said , going different hotel . driver laughed - first time ferried weary Britannia survivers alternate accommodation . One comment offerred number times pulled guests find staff standing around talking , absolutely intention helping anyone bags . fairness , one waiter breakfast room gave good service.I never consider staying Britannia .
Aug 23 2005 Huge room great breakfast Twin room spacious , nice view Canary Wharf Millenium dome , dockland railway outside window disturb us , breakfast excellent value , three course feast . Takes bit time get underground , Jubilee line quite speedy.Leisure facilities could coat paint bit TLC . Last Minute price deal excellent - full price range .
Jun 12 2005 mixed bag stayed Hilton Docklands 3 weeks earlier interesting compare two . plus side room International bigger access Docklands Light Railway ( DLR ) Tube 5 minute walk away . side , breakfast worse Hilton yoghurt muesli signs telling sort milk juice drinking . promised free bottle wine never materialised weather warm kept window open deafened sound DLR went bridge South Quays Heron Quays stations . find strange big difference ratings hotel Hilton across river - think taking things account 's little difference .
Jun 10 2005 Bland ! reading bad reviews somewhat apprehensive staying . Check ok , mentioned double bed 2 singles pushed together . Breakfast ok. Bad points horrendous stifling heat bedrooms night time , a/c must kick . Everywhere including non-smoking rooms smells stale tobacco entire hotel needs revamp . Major gripe cant use phone room unless authorise £50 credit card activated.Dont think would stay .
May 30 2005 Somewhat ordinary Hotel o.k . unspectacular . stayed one night . exterior brutish somewhat unwelcoming . Unfortunately , interior ( cleared reception ) varies garish , dated downright tacky.The hotel badly needs overhaul . decor needs enlivening . Staff fine though.Worst bit leisure facility . pool really poor state - peeling plastework evidence mould ceiling.For purportedly 4 star hotel , think owners must really better this.I would pitch like 2/3 stars - extent £125 night weekend break family room feel like good value thought would ! ! spent two previous nights Premier Travel Inn £48 night . worse International ......
Apr 28 2005 Excellent Stay Excellent Hotel great location , many bars shops close . Also short walk away Undergound DLR .
Apr 9 2005 Good hotel noisy Recently took 2 day break hotel . Extremely easy find right centre Docklands next Canary Wharf tower . Easy drive hotel car parking £15 per day underneath . also reached Docklands light railway Canary Wharf underground station Jubilee line . stops around 10 minute walk hotel . Initially presentation entrance reception hotel good . Staff helpful , tang european accents case many uk hotels . Room perfectly adequate twin ensuite . Great views London River Thames 12th floor . Price excellent value leisure break costing around £150 including breakfast nights . Easy book rooms line . Large amount building work currently taking place area although mainly confined working hours 8 - 5 cause us problems noise . Looks like planning permission granted large 15 tower building erected next hotel started yet certainly restrict hotel views completed probably couple years time would suggest create noise whilst built . Biggest noise problem experienced light railway elevated across dock . runs every 3 minutes 5.30am midnight sounds like jet plane taking . get used first night make interesting viewing hotel room . Hotel well placed outside hustle bussle central London reached tube , bus railway 30 minutes hotel .
Apr 6 2005 probably better husband live London needed place stay leases . Britannia week Novotel Greenwich ( much better ) . hotel good points . convenient Canary Wharf DLR Jubilee line . room bathroom spacious clean enough old style furnishings may considered quaint ( tacky ) . concierge duty evenings fantastic.The restaurant pizzaria food overpriced quality . worst parts uncomfortable bed eternity spent lifts every day . n't good night 's sleep week.We paid 100 pounds per night much . Novotel Greenwich little way , spent 75 per night excellent hotel .
Mar 15 2005 wonderfull hotel hotel wonderfull , could fault breakfast overpriced , Two bowles cereal cupper nearly £13.The Room Jacuzzi room actually supprised good ( go easy bubble bath thing multiplys ) , large room nice view , staff helpfull without intrusive , dinner resaurant fab 3 course meal £13.50 bargain matter come from.The bar comfortable view river , important clean .You wont dissapointed .
Mar 1 2005 Good lively hotel ! Ive stayed number times , rooms average size old style decor clean comfortable . Breakfast tasty eat buffet . best bit hotel bar seems stay open till 5am week 3am weekend . Really nice friendly atmosphere . would definately stay . Prices vary seems cheepest book hotel groups website .
Feb 19 2005 Looks great actually average stayed Britannia couple times amazed fluctuating levels service . times happy seems middle-ground terms service ( truly dreadful ) quality rooms.I sure first opened great general over-the-top decor chintzy look belies fact hotel really n't good.Expect wait ages check-out lifts ( seem break-down lot ) . Also expect fairly shambolic breakfast served hard-worked imported staff speak little English.I understand hotel teeters edge exclusion major travel companies booking business e.g . Hogg Robinson / BTI 's easy see ... Hilton , Docklands side river actually much better hotel - extra 10 minutes away . Alternatively , bigger budgets stretch Four Seasons excellent .
Dec 4 2004 Good night long holiday ... stayed Britannia International Hotel night dicounted price . room comfortable quiet lovely view furniture bedsheets/blankets certainly need replacement . staff delightful , completely overbooked following night found hotel room another hotel discounted rate extremely helpful . Every staff person met helpful disagree reviews terms staff . would stay one night since found decor quite depressing outdated area safe , convenient underground nice shopping centre nearby . views hotel brilliant interior definitely needs style re-vamping , shabby reproductions art , halogen lamps 80s bizarre chandelier right window . would stay ( perhaps longer ) rennovated bit !

Would consider staying would double check situation deposits first !

'll get , get easy.This hotel pretty expensive try book advance Internet ( get 60 % discount rate ) .We 've week ( 9-16 August 2004 ) , would surely return . Overall - great place .
Nov 7 2004 glad didnt pay full price got cheap room first night london flight , basically didnt intend going sightseeing wanted rest take things easy . Found room nice , staff polite . thing could really find fault fact room hot AC didnt seem make difference double bed fact 2 single mattresses made things little harder ; ) location secluded peaceful , rooms par 4 * hotels ive stayed around world . Would go price good ( £70 ) first night long flight little local surrounding area .
Sep 28 2004 Get suite ! checked quickly helpful staff . Unfortunately legibility room number departure date attached key meant return desk re-confirm . date departure looked decidedly like 25 26 , despite several assurances desk staff glad find door keys still worked evening 25th.The room adequate size issues maintenance room . lavatory flushing handle hanging precariously wall obviously time . back remote control missing keep batteries pressed make work . know things result misuse previous guests obvious defects sorted out.Our travelling companions junior suite much better value . view across London balcony impressive.I disappointed rather petty £2.50 additional charge pool leisure facilities . would liked commented well failed mention time booking restricted opening hours weekendDon ’ get wrong , hotel ’ bad certainly stayed worse hotels London ( much worse ! ) . Shop around weekend discounts – pay full price feel short changed . Get suite , ’ well worth extra .
Sep 9 2004 Excellent hotel peaceful area water . sister stayed hotel four days stay London pleased choice . got excellent deal internet included breakfast ( supposed Continental able full English breakfast every morning breakfast buffet , nice dining room right next water ) . room comfortable plenty storage , air conditioning worked ! nice , private view water . twin beds narrower used Canada , adequate . Tea coffee service provided room . bathroom large jacuzzi tub bidet ( anyone actually use ? ) .The location perfect us . quiet peaceful - loud traffic noise . short walk South Quay Station Docklands Light Railway , Canary Wharf underground station short walk along pedestrian walkway , water , behind hotel . took us Jubilee shopping area Jubilee Underground line excellent , modern , clean , easy access.If looking hotel right middle tourist attractions , n't , want excellent quality peaceful area , easy access underground , highly recommend Britannia International Docklands
Sep 6 2004 4 star ! really 4 star hotel . stayed night 27 Aug . unable get executive room , despite 3 key changes concierge & quot ; thumped & quot ; lock ! room shabby , bathroom poor towels dingy coloured ( grey ) oppsoed true colour white . bin contained wrapper one two packs allotted biscuits . fridge newspapers . hallway needed cleaning hotel staff must learn DISTURB means exactly ! view location excellent worth 5 stars .
Aug 27 2004 Definitely four star hotel greatly disappointed brief stay Britannia International Hotel . visited London business pleasure , glad stay Britannia International one night . absolutely complaints local Docklands area . great variety cafes , shops entertainment local areas . dockland views relaxing prestigious city building blocks remind New York Boston skyscrapers . location conveniently located near Canary Wharf train station links Tower Bridge ’ underground station . short space time travel directly Houses Parliament Big Ben , Tower London Buckingham Palace . managed fit whirlwind tour London two hours ! good idea buy all-day travel pass local trains , underground buses , bought train station £4.70 . hotel offering tours £16 , made big saving.The hotel hand bit let . standard service rooms poorest level ever experienced “ four star hotel ” . hotel three star hotel best , contained number restaurants swimming pool . Reception staff rude unfriendly , plus good English skills . ordered breakfast bed , price stated room service menu ended costing £21 ! person brought meal unfriendly , spoke little English stood middle room yet dressed properly . Furthermore , cleaner tried enter room 9am ( us like slight lie-in ! ) . Breakfast exciting consisting croissant , two small rolls , toast standard cornflakes , fresh orange . went buffet restaurant eat good value money , great standard food . room fine , starting become little shabby . mirror bathroom starting discolour , lamp verge going bin , bed sheets old-fashioned ’ keen shower curtains hotels.However , good points hotel . best part hotel views . decided hold business meeting lounge overlooking docks , civilised relaxed setting . Furthermore , ’ complaints room view , looked water even partially showed Millennium Dome.I would recommend staying hotel holiday break.It ok one night , ’ looking somewhere else Docklands area next time visit .
