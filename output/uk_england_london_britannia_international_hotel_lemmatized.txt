	 Great Hotel . lively 	 this be a great hotel . stay in room 609 which be very spacious . friendly staff , large room and easy access to central london ( about 25mins by tube ) . the room and the hotel itself could do with a facelift , but for comfort and quality I would stay here again . I get a good price online because I book early . I have stay in many London hotel with cramp room and rude staff but this be a very professional place 	
	 do not stay here the room and food be awful ! ! ! ! 	 I and my partner stay here for the weekend just go and we think the hotel be not very nice . the room need up date , it be all old fashioned furniture and style . at first we be not too bother about that then we go down for breakfast and the food be terrible . the scramble egg be runny , there be not veggy option which be not good as I do not have a good choice of food I could get . the tea and coffee be cold and the fruit be not fresh at all ! ! ! ! would not recomme to stay here ! ! ! 	
 Nov 23 2009 	 Fancy breakfast with stranger ? if so go here . 	 my mum and I travel to london for the weekend in october and we be lucky enough not to have to be in the room for very long at all . the location be good as it be only a small walk away from a shopping centre and the tube station and as you enter the hotel it look lovely . we arrive on the friday afternoon and be ask if we would like to upgrade our room for £ 25 extra . the lift be slow to arrive and sometimes do not arrive at all even after press the button countless time . the view be good but the window do not open and the air conditioning be break so the room be very stuffy . the bed be resonably comfy and the bathroom as quite nice , but the breakfast have to be the bad breakfast I have ever have you go in and sit at large table with people you do not even know , we eat breakfast as quickly as we could and go to buy it elsewhere . I do not enjoy be in the hotel much but thankfully have a excellent time see wicked and ross noble while there . 	
 Nov 21 2009 	 do not stay here 	 I too suffer attempt blackmail at check - in . the receptionist want £ 30 for a ' well ' room . all indication be that he expect this to be in cash into his hand . whilst the room be adequate ( and the shower - the good part of the stay - surprisingly good ) the bathroom suffer from nicotine stain on the ceiling . the restaurant staff be rude and at breakfast require full payment before you could even enter the breakfast room so be prepared to make your English / continental selection before you even see any food . from their website you could be fool into thinking there be WiFi available but this seem to be restrict to certain room type . the hotel be tired and run by bandit - my advice be to spend your money elsewhere . 	
 Nov 16 2009 	 good experience except for attempt blackmail when check in 	 the receptionist explain that we be in an exec - deluxe room ( or something like that ) which be very good and our rate be an excellent one . pause . but for only £ 40 more we could have an excellent room . & quot;No , thank you,&quot ; I say . he then scribble a room number on a slip and push it towards we . & quot;smoke be fine&quot ; he say , more of a statment than a question . & quot;smoke be not fine,&quot ; I say . he then state dimissively , it will have to be a standard room . More scribble and & quot;Twin bed be OK?&quot ; no , I say , we pay for a non smoking double and that be what we expect . he mutter and then wait , no doubt expect we to say , go on then , we will pay the extra but then his colleague shout across a room number and he scribble some more and give we our room number without say anything else . I can not help but feel he be work to a script or on commission but it be disgraceful . the room itself be clean and comfortable . quite a new toilet and tiled floor , carpet look clean and fairly new , bed be comfortable and clean , room temperature be fine and it be fairly quiet . dining room for breakfast be hot and crowded but cooked breakfast be fine . I be charge more than the overnight parking rate give on the web , if fact more than the 24 hour rate . I only realise that later though :( I book in a rush before get a chance to read review , and my heart sink when I read some of the bad experience . but apart from the check - in blackmail I be very pleasantly surprised . it must be hit or miss . the extortion attempt would make I avoid it in the future and not recommend it . 	
 Nov 14 2009 	 it´s amazing and very british kind 	 very nice hotel . good bed , good shower , good apartment . there be a very good Bar and Pizzeria restaurant . the location be next to the Canary Wharf tube station and it be easy to go anywhere . I strongly recomment it . 	
 Nov 14 2009 	 stay here at your peril .... 	 we stay here and here it be in simple term .... we order food , bit of the order do not show we be then late for our West end show!the staff be rude and just do not care!the maid come into our room without stop to call out or knock!There be a party in the room next to we and the hotel take a long time to sort it!we complain and they give we a complimentary room , the hassle it take to get it book be clearly design so we would quite simply give up . do not insult yourself by stay here the STAFF and MANAGEMENT just dont CARE , which be a pity as the LOCATION be ok .... REAL PITY . 	
 Nov 5 2009 	 awful - much nice hotel to stay in for same price 	 I recently stay for 1 night at the Britannia Hotel and since I be on business I be not look for a luxurious stay , just a clean comfortable room that I feel safe in . sadly the room do not tick any of these box . the room be extremely noisy with the tube just 150 m away run past my room and I could hear next door telephone conversation . the bed linen be wear , tatty with stain , drawing on the wall , dirty carpet , tv be on the floor , and the mattress be very old and uncomfortable . my door be bang every 30 sec from the wind whistle down the corridor . somehow I manage to ignore all those thing , mind over matter they say and attempt to log onto the internet . I could not connect so telephone reception to be tell they do not have internet access from the room but there be access down in the lobby however it be break at that time - genius ! that be the icing on the cake , I pack up my thing , proceed to reception , demand a refund and move to a hotel down the road who upgrade I once I tell they about my awful experience at the Britannia Hotel . this hotel be in desperate need of a big shake up . I have stay in well hostel than this . Don't waste your money , find another hotel . 	
 Nov 4 2009 	 Conveinent for O2 	 we pick this hotel base on its location : one stop on the tube from the O2 ( after an event ) and very close to my husband 's office in Canary Wharf . it be fine if you just need a place to crash for the night in that area and get a good deal but do not expect anything special . the main drawback are:-very hot room , very noisey and poor A / c and unable to open windows;- next to DLR line ( although it do not run all night)-thin wall so you could hear your neighbour flush their loo , shower , tvs etc;-noisey loo flush ( so take ear plug if you be a light sleeper);-generally tired and out of date decor;-hard bed ; and - poor quality linen . it could really do with a refurbishment . 	
 Oct 31 2009 	 very poor value 	 badly in need of refurbishment . Wallpaper be from a scene out of Only Fool 's & amp ; horse . Decor be pre 1970 's , television in our room could have be buy at a car boot sale for about £ 20.room be hot and could not turn down temperaturedouble bed be 2 single bed push together , and not at all comfortableif this hotel be 4 star then I rule the world ! ! ! 	
 Oct 25 2009 	 Mouse in dining room ! ! ! 	 just get back from the bad hotel stay of my life here . my daughter and I have a day in London plan when I receive an email from Britannia Hotels offer a special deal so we decide to book in and make a weekend of it . bad decision . the room be smelly and stuffy , it be very hot even though we have the heating turn down to 16 degree , and there be no window that we could open . there be 10 very noisy fan on the roof right outside our bedroom , room 503 , which be on all the time and be so loud it be almost impossible to sleep . we be put on the same corridor as a group of school child who be incredibly noisy and be run up and down the corridor scream into the small hour . the decor be very tatty , the bottom of the bed be fray and it be so narrow it be difficult to turn over in the night without fall out . to top it all , we try the carvery in Jenny 's restaurant on our first night and as we be finish dinner we spot a mouse run around under the table scout for supper . we point it out to the waiter who do not seem too surprised because it be not the first time he have see it there . definately a hotel to avoid . 	
 Oct 25 2009 	 Grubby worn and unhelpful . 	 I stay in the International Britannia Hotel with about 15 pupil and staff as part of a conference be hold for two day , three night . roomthe room be incredibly date to say the least . the decor be hideous and without a theme . the artwork be quite raunchy , include naked people in suggestive position ( remember I be a student ) . the tv do not work and the only way it could be turn off be at the switch , neither do the remote . the toilet door would not lock , one person be put on a camp bed , the front door break so it be a struggle for it to lock so no - one could come in without a card . the only way to boil the kettle be to balance it on the bed due to the immense lack of normal plug socket . we phone up reception three time to get someone to come up to fix the tv , they manage to do it but the manager who came say he would send up maintainence to fix the door . he do not . we have to call a further three time and even then it only get fix as we be leave on the third day despite all the call occur on the first day . the mirror be break and the view be of a construction site ( include the lovely sound at 6 am ) . as we walk into the room we find an apple on the chandelier from the last inhabitant . the air con be noisy and it never have a decent temperature , it be either glacial or boiling . the bed be not too bad except the camp bed . the hot drink facility be good as there be a variety to choose from such as hot chocolate , decaf , tea etc . facilitiesprior to the stay , we have be reassure that there would be a swimming pool and gym avaliable to we when we be not in the conference room . so after a day of meeting all the group want be to work out and go for a swim , however , the swimming pool be shut for the Friday and Saturday we be there for and the gym be unavaliable on the Saturday due to a class be teach . when we do manage to get into the gym , it have a nice range of high - tec machine and there be a bar closeby for anyone want the spa or some fruit , an energy bar or a drink . the swimming pool be surprisingly small compare to the photo show on the website and incredibly cold , quite clearly unheated . the sauna and steam room be very nice . RESTAURANTSIn the morning , our group have the breakfast buffet at Jenny 's restaurant , in the afternoon we have pizza in the pizzeria and in the evening we have the three - course carvery meal . the food from Jenny 's restaurant be faultless . it have a wide range for both vegetarian and such . the meat from the carvery be outstanding and the entire breakfast be brilliant . the pizzeria do not quite have the same effect with I . the pizza be burn and airy and the coke that come with the pizza be barely a drip until our last meal there where they decide to give we full pint glass . I would recommend Jenny 's restaurant to any stayer of the hotel but I would not recommend the pizzeria to anyone . EXPENSEI do not have anything to do with the booking and such so I have not get much of a clue about the cost of the stay itself , only of the bar . for a 200ml bottle of coke it be £ 2 . I think that be really take the mick as the restaurant sell pint of coke for £ 2 . I be not impress by the price of that . I think that anyone who wish to stay in London should look elsewhere . for a & quot;4 star hotel&quot ; , I would struggle to give it 2 star . I can imagine it be very expensive and very disappointing to people who pay for it . I definitely think that there be far well hotel in the area . 	
 Oct 25 2009 	 a promising exterior but seriously lack inside 	 I stay here with friend for one night & amp ; that be more than enough . the room be a good size , but date and poorly sound - proof . we be keep awake at night by the DLR and extremely noisy air - con , then wake by the noise from the construction site next door , then a cleaner let herself into the room at 8 am . we pre - book the continental breakfast at £ 6 per head , which consist of oily croissant , two cereal , some roll and process cheese , along with horrendous coffee and stewed tea . this hotel claim a four - star rating - I have stay in two - star accommodation that have be far well . 	
 oct 22 2009 	 Nice Hotel nice staff dissapointe discuste with duty manager decision tho 	 Dec 2008 I have a 10 day Holiday in London , brittannia be recommend to I . I book cheap on line for 3 night , to treat myself . very impressed with the front desk and staff . I get little sleep , due to train noise from 6.30 am til 11.30 pm odd - plus the heating / cool system would not regulate to a comfortable level . the room be spacious enough and bath luxurious . last day I use the health / gym / pool facility downstairs , decide to treat myself to a tanning booth session ( the minimnum 6 odd minute ) . be use to regular tanning at home & amp ; having recently return from Africa , my colour fading .. the booth be DEF faulty or have BRAND new bulb in the pod ... I be S e v e r l Y b u r N t after just half my session . pod with new bulb normally have a warning sign on they to reduce tanning time . when I Panicked & amp ; ring through to reception to explain , the Hotel refuse to take any responsibility & amp ; the duty manager say I must have have an allergic reaction - which be ridiculous be use to regular tanning . I be BADLY BURNT all over / SICK & amp ; need EMERGENCY Hospital attention , this be get late at night - the burning have take all evening to become sore . . after an hour of plead and explain at the desk the Hotel be kind enough to phone / book I a taxi ( at my expense ) & amp ; print I a & quot;courtesy&quot ; map of the near Hospital . even though I tell they I have no cash leave for a taxi & amp ; I be lose in that area of London . the desk staff take my mobile tel no & amp ; say they would call I later on , I have no credit on my Mb either . a female , sick & amp ; alone at Midnight I walk out lose towards the Hosp with their map . { my travel pal be not with I the last night } when I return 3 hour later on strong coedine pill , with medicine & amp ; a prescription for the morning I be FURIOUS at my eve ordeal . in severe pain , nauseous , shake , no body temperature control , & amp ; scare for my own safety out on foot in dark street . in the Hosp the desk staff have ring my mobile , but my phone be switch off in the hosp . the manager even make I then beg he to let I check out later than normal in the morning . in the middle of my holiday I have to make alternative plan to get straight home , which be expensive and inconvienient to say the least . after a 2 week recovery period & amp ; various doctor 's visit - I write in length to Brittannia with detail from the Doctor who have examine my burn skin & amp ; letter of proof to say I use tan booth regularly , etc .... STILL have N o reply as yet . P.S. the morning I check out , the tanning booth be open as usual , as if nothing have happen .   now I be curious to see if I get a reply on here ! ! TOTALLY discuste treatment in such a high class Hotel . 	
 Oct 15 2009 	 Fantastic Value for Money ! 	 a place to stay for a trip to see the Jersey Boys and , after trawl the internet I come across the Britannia . we get a special deal for a twin room that include breakfast so to be honest at £ 158 for two night for two people we be not expect the Ritz . however how wrong be we in fact what we get be a warm , smiley welcome which set the theme for the weekend . I have to be honest we be give a room that immediately put I in the ' grr ' frame of mind , one right by the lift and one that although it back on to the waterfront also to the DLR railway . I always travel with earplug so to be honest it would not have be a problem however we never have any distubance from the lift and the railway , due to engineering work only run on the Friday evening . my only other three issue with the room be that the twin bed be single one , I guess that come with be spoil at other hotel that provide double , the shower head ( tiny ) and lack of lighting ( make - up application ) . other than that everyting be pretty much spot - on . we decide to eat in on Friday , no booking require and head to Jenny 's Carvery . fantastic helpful , friendly staff one of whom when we depart on Sunday morning after our ample full english , shake our hand and say ' it be always sad when nice people check out ' ! three course for £ 15 - excellent ! our only critiscm here be lack of signage - nothing to say three course , some of the food item on offer and refreshment on the tea / coffee table do not have appropriate signage . the whole bill for both with drink come to £ 40.saturday morning we sample the breakfast selection , fruit , yoghurt , toast , cereal and full English . obviously we do not have all of the above ( no yoghurt ) and again it be excellent . we dine in the Pizzeria Saturday evening - total bill with tip for starter , main ( include perfectly cook sea bass ) come to £ 47 for two . the only disappointment be the coffee in the bar later in the evening , although the Baileys cheer they up!again on Sunday we enjoy the breakfast . all in all I be look forward to stay there again in the near future . I can not speak highly enough of the staff . it be worth mention too that the waiter in the Pizzeria have work there for several year which for the hotel / catering industry speak volume . a big thumb up Britannia International - in a climate of financial doom and gloom you certainly put two big smile on these ' girl ' face ! on - site parking too at excellent rate - thank you ! 	
 oct 13 2009 	 1st class hotel 	 stay with friend at Brit . hotel canary wharf , great all round hotel , very good food room very comfortable , and very good and friendly service , would use again . 	
 Oct 11 2009 	 not too bad alright to stay in 	 the first thing I notice about the hotel be after see the typical characterless outside the inside seem like another world . I think it seem very odd but it do not bother I much although it be not my favourite style . Staff seem alright but live up to the ' international ' part of the name . it be a bit far out than most hotel but as I be use to do a 30min each way commute back home , 15 minute on the tube to Central London be not an issue . bed in my room be pretty horrible to sleep on , and the lift to the fourth floor be like try to catch public transport ( wait 5 minute then it be too full to get in ) . the selection of restaurant be not to crash for the night if you get a good deal price wise.great but overall the place be alright 	
 Oct 5 2009 	 great value very comfortable . 	 be offer an upgrade to a deluxe room at no extra cost- very quick sign in from courteous staff .. have a 9th floor room with the most amazing view of both the Thames and Canary Wharf . spacious room - nicely decorate and pristinely clean . Couldn't have ask for anything well . wonderful location right next to DLR and Jubilee Line ( check weekend work closure for Jubilee at present ) . also within a stone 's throw of Canary Wharf pier with clipper boat service to Westminster , O2 and Greenwich .Brillant boat service , but pricey . well to but a Roamer ticket to give all day hop on and off travel- you can even go through the Thames Barrier on Clipper . an evening clipper trip in the dark be wonderful- but beware that the ticket expire at 10 pm and you will be charge again after that time . combine with inclusive continental breakfast this stay be a brilliant deal . I would reccommend it wholeheartedly . I be put off by other review on this hotel on Tripadvisor , but I do not experience any of the negative comment post there . 	
 Sep 29 2009 	 poor quality - tired and in need of update 	 look I be sorry but for a hotel of this location where everything in Canary Wharf be ultra modern , clean and gleaming , this hotel stand out like a sore thumb the moment you enter it . gaudy and kitch - way out date and very tired . the decor in the room be a mish mash which all look incredibly date - not to mention the incredibly odd ( and raunchy ! ) artwork . above my dark wood ornate headboard be a very bizarre print of naked men!The bed be way way beyond it be sell by date and I can just about feel the spring push through . bedding be cheap and basic with hard pillow . the skirting on the bed be fray and so crease it will never be straight and smooth again . the room be clean and do not smell - the view be ok and the noise level be well contain . those be about the only plus point . seriously , go somewhere else if you have the option . 	
 Sep 26 2009 	 Noisy and unfriendly 	 not worth the price , the DLR drive I nut , the aircon be erratic the staff could only speak basic English . I have backpack around the world by myself and have never feel as uncomfortable as this place , I end up put the chair against the door handle . it be sleazy , the pool area be staff by greasy man that be just revolt . 	
 Sep 20 2009 	 great stay - as usual 	 this be our third stay at the Britannia and we have enjoy it on each occasion . we stay for seven night this time and if anything the hotel have improve since our last visit . we arrive at 7.15 am and be meet by the concierge who come outside and carry our case into the hotel where we leave they until we come back to check in at 4 pm when we have probably the swift check in ever in our many visit to London . whilst our room do not have the fantastic view we have enjoy on previous visit , as usual it be large than normal for a London hotel . as ever it be spotlessly clean and have more amenity than we often get in4 * hotel in London . we have a trouser press , iron , iron board and even a set of bathroom scale . our one gripe on our previous visit be that breakfast be rather chaotic and the serve staff disintereste . now however breakfast seem to serve in separate room depend on which type you be have with coach party have a restaurant to themselves . this result in we have a very relaxing continental breakfast in a light and airy room look after by a very obliging young waiter . we have a choice of fruit juice , cereal , yoghurt , roll , croissant , toast , cheese and cold meat . this be a very comfortable hotel with great travel connection practically on it be doorstep and it be good to see that opinion on this site be start to reflect this after go through a period of very critical review which I could never understand . I would have no hesitation in recommend it to other . 	
 Sep 14 2009 	 Nice and Quiet in a clean Part of London 	 be nicely surprised with this hotel on approach from the clipper service it do look a bit tatty but the entrance be very inviting and the staff be very courteous . the room be air condition and there be a choice of smoking or nonsmoke very rare these day ! ! ! we have the top flor room with a nice view down the Thames and a slight view of Canary Wharf and the O2 . could do with dress gown in the room but this be the only complaint really . transport link be quite good with DLR , and tube service close by , also the hotel seem to have its own chaffeuer service , at very reasonable rate , we use this service to go to Mayfair and it be the same price as a black cab ! all in all a decent hotel 	
 Sep 9 2009 	 tired hotel Tired Traveller 	 I stay here for 1 night having be bump from Radisson NPW , my usual haunt . ( grr ) . first impression be ok , reception staff ftriendly if a little slow . then up top the room , walk in and hit by a wave of depression ( ok I be tired ) . Room be gfloomy , outside the window be the noisy air handle unit , decor be just plain odd , bathroom do not have a free standing shower but one that you have to stoop to get into ( pet hate ) , and no minibar ( this be 4*?!)room service be grim , get sirloin steak that I think have be cook for 2 hour in vinegar . no cold beer in my choice . no iron in the room , and an age to track someone down to answer the phone to send one upgym do not open till 7 , no good for a business traveller who like to be at the desk for 8 . avoid breakfast , and join the long checkout queue instead . in summary , I will be avoid this place . it need a complete revamp , and a decent chef . 	
 Sep 7 2009 	 Fantastic Hotel - Penthouse Suite a must ! ! 	 I book the Penthouse Suite for myself and my boyfriend . after book I read some review of this site and be a bit nervous about it as some review be say the hotel be a bit date and the room be in need of update . but upon arrive at the International nothing could be more wrong . the foyer itself be beautiful and the decoration be by no mean tired and date . it be traditional and quite grand . maybe the people write bad review prefer trendy , modern and minimalist decor hence the comment . the reception staff could not have be more friendly and helpful . the penthouse suite itself be stunning . upon enter the room there be an iron spiral staircase take you up to the suite . the living room be very spacious with mahogany sideboard , dining table and dresser and leather sofas with floor to ceiling window lead out onto a private balcony with stunning view . the bedroom be spacious although obviously small than the living area and beautifully decorate again with stunning view of Canary Wharf and beyond . the bathroom have a jacuzzi bath big enough for two ! the location of the hotel be a bit far from the centre of London if that s be you want to go and I believe there be a train not to far away to take you into the centre but we take the Thames Clipper fast ferry which be only a five minute walk away from the hotel which take you to all different part of London and I would recommend this . all in all I would highly recommend this hotel and will definately stay again . 	
 Sep 2 2009 	 good value 	 I stay at this hotel with my mum and 8yr old Nephew for two night . it be very reasonable and not book directly with the hotel . the room be fine , three single bed as it be a family room , we overlook the water which be quite a lovely view . the room and bathroom be clean . the breakfast be include as continental but we just walk into the main place and have the buffet full english . we be not challenge but it be about twenty min before close time as my nephew would not get out of bed ! the food be lovely , try to get a hot drink be very difficult . the staff be very busy and seem to forget . the pool be quite cold and there be a terrible smell in the change room , if you be look to stay at a hotel just to enjoy the pool facility I really would not reccomend this one . overall this hotel be fine for two night , the location be good , about a ten min walk from the tube and dockland railway . 	
 Aug 29 2009 	 we have a great stay in this place ! 	 I have just return from a five day break in London with my friend . the hotel be book as part of a package so we have no idea what to expect . I be glad I do not read all the review on this site before I go . it be clean , comfortable , the staff be helpful , our bedroom and bathroom be clean , spacious and well equip . so maybe not evryone like chandelier - you can choose your own decor at home , how be hotel suppose to please all taste ? and if you do not want to see and hear a train or a tube from your window - do not choose a hotel in Canary Wharf area right next to a dlr stop ! I would stay here again , the location be fantastic and my only very slight complaint be the way some of the tour group be shove upstairs out of the way in a conference room for breakfast . 	
 Aug 28 2009 	 Britannia International Hotel canary Wharf London 	 I have just come back from a four - night break in London with my friend . it be book as a package through a coach tour company and we have no idea what to expect but we be most impressed ! it be a brilliant location , a lovely clean hotel , helpful staff , great breakfast . the room be spotlessly clean and the bathroom be lovely - even have a bathroom scale ! . since return home I have check out the review on this site and can not believe some of the negativity - although I get the feeling that some of the bad one go back a year or two . speak as of now , August 2009 , I absolutely recommend this place . so what if you do not like the decor in a hotel , all you reviewer out there ? you get to choose your own at home . how do you expect hotel to please everyone ? and if you do not like be able to see or hear a train or a tube - go to the countryside!!My only slight grouch be that coach party be expect to be separate in some sort of converted conference room which be a bit less atmospheric than the main dining room and have quite a bit less choice , although it be still the full brecky . remind you that maybe some of we package hol . traveller be the poor relation ? 	
 Aug 24 2009 	 a very pleasant stay - would definitely go back 	 after read some of the review on here I be a little dubious about book this hotel but take a gamble and it certainly pay off . we have a pleasant stay and the room be very spacious and more than up to our expectation . we be put in a double room on the 10th floor at the front of the hotel in the direction of Canada Square with a wonderful view over the water . the room be very clean with a nice en - suite and be decorate in what I would call non - offensive classic style . the bed be comfy and certainly not lumpy as per some of the other comment on here . we actually have a very good night sleep . People who complain about thing like chandelier , mirror in the lift and ornament in the corridor be quite frankly just look for any little thing they can to moan about ! ! the hotel staff seem friendly and helpful enough , and the hotel itself certainly be not smelly . in fact the corridor and room have a noticeable fragrance smell about they . I agree that the include continental breakfast in the pizzeria restaurant be quite basic but you have to accept that as a freebie you be not go to get a banquet . if you be really not happy with the selection offer then you do have the choice of walk 10 metre across to the main restaurant and pay £ 13.50 per person for a much big choice of breakfast , include full English . we do not pay any extra ourselves and be quite happy with the basic breakfast of cereal , croissant , roll , toast , cheese / conserve , yoghurt and juice / tea / coffee . if you want a good deal then make sure you search one of the travel supermarket type website instead of book direct with the hotel . this be what I do and get our double room for a nightly rate of £ 59 include breakfast which be an absolute bargain and even cheap than a lot of budget type hotel with a low star rating and no breakfast include . base on our experience we would definitely go back to this hotel again . 	
 Aug 13 2009 	 how many chandelier ! ! 	 Hi , having read previous review I though ' well can not be that bad ' , I mean chandelier be not always a bad thing . as we get drop off to the hotel I be think , good move here , the place look pretty darn sweet . into the reception area , I be suddenly remind of a review I have read , serious chandelier overload!The reception lobby be a kind of victorian theme but in a bad 80 's style!i always gauge a hotel on how long it take to get check in , well there be only one member of staff on , at 7 pm on a Sunday evening!waite for the lift we have a chuckle about the number of chandelier , and into the lift . seriously , remove some mirror , I have already be to the barber , I do not need a mirror infront , behind , and all around I , I have no need to be remind of how great my hair look from each side , nor do I need to see an infinate number of myself , get small and small as I peer into the mirror . out of the lift , we be greet by some strange fat chineese warrior hold some sort of a weapon , oh come on , victorian/80 's and now some chineese ornaments!Into the room , twin bed that might as well have be a double there be such a small gap between the bed . I mean we be friend but not that close friends!another good guage of a hotel be the tv in the room , well this baby should have be on antique road show , I be suprise not to see a Fergison Video Star beneth it!The bed be hard as nail and I have a spodge of blood on my sheet , always make a good impression!I do like the bar downstair that be level with the water outside . the pizza 's be quite nice , although it do come with olive I ask for no olive but that be easily fix . needless to say I very much doubt I will be stay at the Britannia Hotel London again very time soon!i think the hotel should rephrase the hi speed wifi sign as well!thank for reading . 	
 Aug 5 2009 	 EXCELLENT 	 really good service and it smell good too . the bed be very comfy and I love the cable tv that really make my night , as well as my boyfriend ;) the pool be nice and clean and the jacuzee be pengte 	
 Aug 5 2009 	 I see thing have not change in 3 year 	 I and my partner stay here some time ago but I have to look it up and can see from current review that the hotel have not change in all this time . the place come across as be build in the initial heyday of thw wharf and then run out of money . we stay two night and the staff be unhelpful , some tray leave outside room on our first night be still there when we leave . the room be shabby and there be no mini bar . when we ask whent he restaurant close we be tell it close when there be no more order . great we think but the food be poor and the room service be no well . it be hard to believe it be 4 star compare to nearby hotel . one to avoid . 	
 Aug 3 2009 	 pleasantly surprised ! 	 stay at this hotel for 1 night as I be go to a gig at the nearby O2 . kind of expect a very basic hotel due to read some review here , but I be pleasantly surprised . sure the hotel be a bit date and a bit shabby but for I its location to Canary Wharf and the O2 along with the very resonable price make it a great choice . room be big than I expect and be good for a single room , except that the bed be a bit hard for I ( but for 1 night that be ok ) . do not eat in the hotel but do use the pool which be a fairly decent facility . Staff be helpful enough . not sure if I would stay here if I be visit central London , but would recommend for concert - goer look for a place to kip after a gig ! ! 	
 Aug 1 2009 	 excellent stay ! I must defend this hotel 	 having read some of the review from people I feel I must defend the hotel . myself and my wife stay at the hotel on the new year break package 2008 and there be no way I can fault it at all . my standard no in no way low and I would be the first person to complain if I have to but some of the review by people be totally unfair to the hotel and staff unless something drastic have happen in the last seven month . anyway the room be excellent I can not remember the number but it have a spiral staircase from the room door up to the bedroom itself and a patio door out onto a balcony be you could see the Thames - excellent clean and all we need . next the food as much as we want to eat sometimes the chef would come round to your table and ask if everything be okay -a nice touch . staff in general be very good and pleasent -thinke back be we talk about the same hotel ! we be definately go to stay this new year 	
 Jul 27 2009 	 LONDON DOCKLANDS MAGIC . 	 I stay here for 2 night with my husband , the hotel be very grand in the foyer but the dinning room be very tired and need a revamp . the table be make of wood and they do not have table cover so look rather grubby , the setting be great actually overlook the water . the room be clean but very date , the view we have be GREAT from the seventh floor , we overlook the dock and the o 2 arena , the dockland light railway , and canary wharf . food be good and plentiful , commplimentory bathroom goody , tea make facility , but the bed leave a lot to be desire , lumpy . the location be fabulous with 5 minute walk to underground and light railway . I love water and train so this more than make up for letdown for me.would definately stay again . 10 minute into town on the underground or light railway , buy a day ticket very good value.we take the open top bus which also include a trip on the river either to geenwich or westminster and the jack the ripper walking tour at £ 24.00 excellent value . 	
 Jul 25 2009 	 with excellent service and accommodation this hotel provide fantastic value 	 Despondent , having read so many negative comment about the hotel , I arrive as part of a bus tour from Scotland , expect grubby and noisy surrounding . to our delight , we quickly realise that we be about to be treat to four very pleasant night . I have ask for a quiet , single room and find that , without any fuss on our arrival , I have be give this on the tenth floor , overlook the Thames . the bed be comfortable and , although a light sleeper , I sleep well . the room and en suite be spotless and attentively attend to by housekeeping every morning ; the buffet breakfast and dinner offer a wide choice in the restaurant , which look out over Canary Wharf ( indeed , if you sit by the window , it feel as though you be at sea ! ) ; and all of the staff be particularly helpful and pleasant . there be no question of be treat as a second - class citizen because we be on a bus trip . independent traveller need have no fear , since , although a lot of group be stay at the hotel , it seem that they have separate restaurant accommodation , although I can not be certain about this . the hotel be ideally situate for all of London , since it be very close to Canary Wharf Tube Station and to the Docklands Light Railway . it take I twenty minute to reach the hotel from the National Theatre on the South Bank and the same time to Greenwich Maritime Museum on the DLR . a Day ticket will cost you only £ 5.60 . so , please , do not be put off by the complaint below ; I do not understand how anyone could find fault with the hotel . 	
 Jul 14 2009 	 so bad that I leave a day early despite having pay in full 	 the staff have ignore guest down to a fine art , the breakfast be pure slop and the shower in the room be a mere trickle , the room be stuffy and noisy , the hotel itself be a bit on the dirty side , the only good thing be the concierge who be always pleasant 	
 Jul 7 2009 	 Hmm ... old and smelly 	 I have be to some nice hotel in my time ... this definitely be not one of they . only stay for one night ( thankfully ) . when I get there , for some reason there be not a room book for I ... annoying . then when I finally get a room , it be decorate in an old fashioned way ( not my style ) and it have an old smell about it . it be not too far from canary wharf which be probably the good thing about it . be not impressed ... don't think I would stay there again . maybe I be be a little bit harsh ... it be good enough for the night really but would not want to stay a bit long . I have become a bit of a snob when it come to hotel as well now ! 	
 Jul 6 2009 	 not 4 Star 	 you can stay in this hotel , but do not expect anything . room be more or less clean , but we have one dirty towel , and two dirty pillow sheet . Breakfast ( continental ) be very very basic ( bun & amp ; croissant with marmalade , and some cereal , orange juice and coffe / tea).definitely okay if you just want to sleep there . 	
 Jun 16 2009 	 Fine Hotel 	 stay 4 nght in April . after read the review on this page I be concern but I think some people like to complain . the room be big than expect , the bathrom be clean , furnishing in good condition , breakfast be plentiful with lot of choice . the walk to Canary Wharf be close than I think it may have be . if you prepurchase a Travelcard it be cheap to get around . stay at a more expensive hotel close to the city centre after our trip to Europe and it be nowhere near as good as this one . on the downside we find everywhere in the UK be overheat and this be no exception . 	
 Jun 13 2009 	 great view   nice place to stay 	 although show its age our stay at this hotel be very enjoyable . it be close to all Londons tourist attraction . the Bar facility be quiet and enjoyable to Chill out after the hustle and bustle . the staff be very attentive and a credit to the hotel . a word to the wise 90 Pound cab fare from heathrow . 	
 Jun 11 2009 	 SOMEWHERE to lay your head ! ! ! 	 if you want to tour London all day and just need a place to rest your head after a day journey , then this be the Hotel for you . and that be be exactly what we do for the 6 night we stay in London . the hotel be pretty much what everyone say , a three star hotel at good , the bed be not the greatest - you do feel the spring poke your body , and the room could by all measure use a face lift . my friend do ask for another mattress and he be provide with one in the same day . the bathroom be decent , the shower be probably the good aspect of the entire room . the room be smal but I guess that should be expect . we have one problem , the sink would not drain our second day there . but Housekeeping fix the problem by the time we return to the room later in the evening . I really do not have too much interaction with the staff , but the little I do go relatively well , no coplaint there . the hotel be not far from the Tube either but the cab ride from the airport to the hotel cost 40 pound , way to much . we end up take a series of train to the airport for the return journey home . take about an hour and a half and 4 - 5 different train , but well worth not spend 40pound on a cab . I will not stay at this hotel if I visitt London again though . it be an ok hotel , it do not require more than one extend stay . 	
 Jun 10 2009 	 my first trip to london 	 I book my weekend with superbreak and pay £ 180 for the 2 of we for 2 night and rail ticket superb value for money . the hotel in dockland be clean and spacious the food be not great but that be ok as we be out most of the time . we go to see britney spear and even though the DLR be not work the rail replacement service be superb we be there within an hour and back within 45mins without a single problem . I think the London transport system be fantastic the long we wait on a train be 8mins . we do some of the tourist spot but do not have enough hour in the day to see everythingI love London and can not wait to go back 	
 Jun 2 2009 	 a bit old fashion - need updating ! ! ! 	 I stay here for 1 night as I be go to the O2 to watch a concert , so in term of location it be fairly good , although when you come off the tube at Canary Wharf I would not really want to be lug suitcase as be still a 10 minute walk from station across a bridge and through a carpark!!!The foyer be very grand but old fashion , very green with chandelier , and it have a bar in the lobby area which be quite nice . we upgrade to a superior suite for £ 20 which they be say be a 1 day special only , but not too sure of that . quite frankly not really worth the £ 20 . the room be big but look like a 70 's sitting room and even though it have a nice view it be a communal balcony which shock I as a random man walk past ! ! ! when you open the door there be a spiral staircase to take you to room , again if I have suitcase I would not be happy , it be bad enough after a few drinks!!I do not have breakfast as leave early but do not think I would 've miss much . all in all a good budget hotel if you stay for maybe a couple of night max , but no more than that . 	
 Jun 1 2009 	 what a stunning view ! 	 great deal ( £ 58 for 2 , inc . excellent continental breakfast . ) view from the 6th floor room be wonderful- across Heron Dock to the Dome . Staff be very pleasant , room very clean . only 1 drawback- near bye Underground be close at the moment ( May 09 ) 	
 May 31 2009 	 Definately not 4 Star ! ! 	 where do I start ? well when book , we request a room on the first to third floor as my husband do not do elevator . when check in we be give a room on the 8th floor . we be tell that the room on the first to 6th floor be only twin bed that could not be move together and be smoke room . meanwhile we notice that our room have two twin bed push together ! the hotel need to put some money into refurbish ..... it be very tired look . the bathroom have peel paint on the ceiling , the toilet flusher be attach to the wall and very loose and the tap which once must have be a gold color be now a scatchy look silver brown . we have a very uncomfortable sleep as the spring in the mattress be stick into our rib and we hear the train go most of the evening and early morning . notice that the window be miss some screw and be open at the top . we inform Front Desk about our problem with the mattress and window . they send someone up to fix the window . at first they be go to switch we to another room and then suddenly there be not another room . we ask for a second duvet to make the mattress more comfortable for sleep and when we return from our evening out , they have only give we the blanket that be in the closet . our friend give we their blanket from their room and when we lift the sheet to put the blanket under they , we be appaule at what we see . the mattress be wear , stain and on the side it be fall apart . my friend take picture with her camera and hopefully will post they but her comment be & quot;I would not let my dog sleep on that mattress!&quot ; do not expect too much in the continental breakfast .... it only consist of cereal , croissant and bun . we have a difficult time get someone to give we more cream for our coffee .... none of the staff be very accomodating or attentive to their customer need . ( a little note here ..... we be visit friend in the UK from Canada and stay here to see some of the sight of London . we be all very open minded , but we feel more of an intrusion on the staff , none of whom seem very excited about work at this hotel ) . the Front Desk staff be not very pleasant to speak to .... (usually you get a smile and a & quot;How can I help you&quot ; when you approach the front desk .... but not at this hotel) .... very somber and stodgy employee ! ! on our second night we be talk to the barman and as he seem very unhappy work there , we ask he if he like his job . his response be & quot;of course not&quot ; . apparently he be an aspire polish IT guy who can not get a job in his field in the UK as his write English be not very good and so he lower himself to the job of Barman for now . the only time we get a smile out of he be when we give he a nice tip . I think the only way to get he to show a little more enthusiasm and life would have be to light a fire under his butt . I think I have cover pretty much our experience with this hotel . would I go back .... no way .... would I recommend it to a friend .... no way .... would I recommend it to an enemy .... DEFINATELY ! ! ( just to get even)anyway .... take my advise .... or don't .... I just want to make sure that people be advise about our experience before they make their own decision . I be sure that by put in some of the money that be charge for the room to upgrade the Hotel it may one day be the hotel that it once be ..... but for now I would stay clear!!Nora WhiteCambridge , Ontaro Canada 	
 May 29 2009 	 only if you be desperate ! 	 my husband and I stay there last night . the room temperature be 25c ! we be absolutely roast all night . try to use the tempurature contol in the room to lower the temperature but it do not work . we be only able to get about 4 hour of sleep we be so hot . as the hotel offer no facility for smoker , if you want to have a cigarette you literally have to get completely dress , go out the front of the hotel , past the drop off point at the entrance and stand on the pavement . if you be a smoker , definitely stay in another hotel that will treat you with dignity . to sum it up , we be out of the hotel at 7:30 am , decide we would rather go sit in Paddington Station for 3 hour and wait for our train home , than stay at that hotel . the decor be out date , the price astronomical we have another concert at the O2 in October , we will be book our hotel room at a different hotel ! 	
 May 27 2009 	 have - be 	 great student hostel but business forget it . this hotel have it be heyday about 15 year ago when it be the only hotel close to Canary Wharf . it be tired , wear out and desperately ready for a makeover . although the room service staff be very polite and helpful the rest of the staff wipe that out . particularly the teenager behind the bar in the spa ( break the trade description act there ) who speak to I so rudely I nearly check out . I could give you a whole list of unpleasant experience I have in this hotel over 4 night but I will not . however , if you be a student , and the hotel be full of they - it be a great place to hang out . for some reason I do not check Trip Advisor - big mistake . 	
 May 19 2009 	 no real problem here . 	 stay here with my wife for 3 night in the middle of May . the main reason for the visit be sightseeing and catch a show or two . I usually check on tripadvisor before I book a hotel and if I be in any doubt I err on the side of caution and do not book a badly review hotel . on this occasion my daughter who be a travel agent say that they have send people here and have not have any adverse comment so I do not bother check it out first . I be glad I do not because I do not think I would have book it read some of the recent review . I find the hotel to be very clean and tidy . the reception staff be very efficient and we check in without a problem . the room although not massive , be perfectly adequate and be also clean and do not appear to need any refurbishment etc as have be report previously . everthing be in a good state of repair etc . there be an iron board , hairdryer and trouser press although we only use the hairdryer . when travel as a tourist I tend to use my hotel for sleep in and possibly have a meal or two so the size of the room be not a major factor for I . the bar staff be also very polite although a bit on the slow side . I also think that the price be expensive even for London . the only real minus point be that I think breakfast be on the expensive side ( £ 13.50 p.p . ) so we do not bother . we simply get something to eat in the shopping area of Canary Wharf which be much more reasonable . also it would have be nice to have something in the room which tell we what time the bar / restaurant be open along with some idea of the price . the other factor which would probably put I off stop here again be not within the control of the hotel or anyone else come that . I just think that it be a bit too far away from the main tourist area of central London . we find that it take between 30 - 60 minute to get where we want . this be despite the fact that there be two tube / dlr station within 5 minute of the hotel . I have no doubt that it be perfectly place for the O2 and if you have business in the Canary Wharf area . as I say above this be outside of the control of the hotel but it be a minus point for our stay . I have only reflect this comment in the location score . 	
 may 11 2009 	 absolutely fine ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 	 I have never write review before , but want to with this hotel for all those people , who like I have book this hotel & amp ; then read the awful review on here & amp ; start to panic about what they be let themselves in for!i've just come back from stay at this hotel with friend as we want to be close to the O2 arena & amp ; it be absolutley fine . whilst I agree it be not a 4 * hotel anymore , the room be large ( we have a triple room ) , with clean bedding & amp ; towel , tea / coffee make facility with biscuit & amp ; the bathroom be more than adequate with decent shower pressure . check - in be a doddle & amp ; the reception staff seem very nice . having stay there I can sort of understand some of the point made:- yes the room be quite warm & amp ; the air con do not seem to do a lot , yes you can hear the tube ( but then if you book a hotel right next to a tube station what do you really expect ! ! ) & amp ; yes the room be very kitsch , but overall for the price & amp ; location it be all good . if I want a hotel near the O2 at a fair price , I would definatley stay here again . 	
 may 11 2009 	 Awsome and nice place 	 Britannia be a nice hotel with high privacy and peace.you can enjoy yourself , staff be really supoortive but you do need to take care of your belong at the cleaning staff be external . 	
 May 5 2009 	 great room and lounge area restaurant and bar open late good service . 	 I travel with a large group of high school student to this hotel . I would recommend it for its large room and bath , and for its large lobby and lounge . the restaurant and bar be open until 2:00 am for food and beverage the hotel be easily access from the tube , but be far enough from London center that the student could not leave the hotel at night . they could convene in the lobby area for card and socializing . for the adult , the lounge be situate on the Thames with floor to ceiling window to take advantage of the beautiful view . many of our room have river view . Breakfast be continental with yogurt and fruit in addition to croissant and roll , ham , cheese and cereal , milk and juice . a very good hotel with great amenity . the entrance to the RER be only a 1 - 2 minute walk , and it be very easy to access all area of London center from this location . I would compare this hotel to a Radisson or Marriott in the USA . 	
 may 5 2009 	 tired and wear out with awful food 	 we travel to London to see Tina Turner at the o2 and look at the trip advisor site after we have book . I wish I have check this out before . the hotel be in desperate need of a refurb and although we be offer a room upgrade this do not compensate for its general grubby wear out feel . the bath be dirty and have a crack in the tub which have be fix with tape ! ! ! and the room have a really odd aroma . on booking in we be offer an upgrade for an extra £ 30 which include breakfast but I have to say it be just not worth it . the breakfast be stone cold and when we query it with the restaraunt manager he advise that someone have turn off the heater in the food cabinet which be why the food be cold . this be patently untrue as we be stand next to the cheff when he bring so call fresh food to the counter which be already cold and indedible . interestingly when we book out several other people be complain about the breakfast as well . as far as accesssibility to the main attrraction , the Thames Clipper Service be only five minute walk up river and this give great access to all of the main attraction include the 02 and be definitely the good way to get to it . if you be go by boat then book your return ticket at the 02 as soon as you arrive to avoid the queing afterwards . my advice would be to find somewhere else to stay and definitely avoid this hotel , I wish we have . 	
 May 4 2009 	 should have check with tripadviser FIRST ! ! ! 	 where do I start ? one of the bad hotel no the bad we have stay in for a very long time . I be so sorry I do not check Trip Adviser before book I would have save my wife and I a lot of aggravation . yes it be near to the O2 but that be about all there be to report favourably . the room be clean but be wear out 10 year ago . I ask at the front desk for a refurbish room and be give 819 . if that be the update version - my granny be a one legged circus performer . the room be stuffy , the air conditioning do not work , the bed squeak if you move your little finger so almost impossible to get any decent sleep . the food be not the bad feature but the level of service be poor . one of the staff - a very grumpy blonde East European that it would take she a half an hour to bring fresh tea to our table . we have to ask the manager to do it for we . whoever own this place should be ashamed of the impression it give of Britain to the european visitor who use it . it appear that the manager read these review but it seem that other than apology no action occur . I would never ever stay here again even if I get it for free ! 	
 May 4 2009 	 Book elsewhere ! 	 not a joke , hotel be very poor ! bath that could not be use , staff that could not be bother ! health facitilie that be not work , broken window ! ! need major refurb ! ! I waste money ! ! 	
 Apr 28 2009 	 do not stay here 	 book this hotel through & quot;Hotels near the O2 arena&quot ; site . our room be like a 19th C Boudoir . horrible decor , rip & amp ; sun - bleach hideous net curtain , broken bath , no plug in sink , no mini bar etc . Docklands Light Railway rumble past our window . DESPERATELY in need of a REFURBISHMENT . how can they possibly call themselves 4 Star ? ? good location for O2 - only 1 stop away on tube . we take the Thames Clipper from Canary Wharf pier to the O2 pier - very pleasant way to travel . hotel very DISAPPOINTING - especially since we have travel so far to get there . 	
 Apr 16 2009 	 not a 4 star hotel but obviously a struggling hotel . 	 the whole hotel be in need of update , the room we stay in be of good size but far from deluxe as state . everywhere be grubby especially the restaurant which remind we of a spanish 2 star all inclusive where the food leave a lot to be desire , poor choice , keep luke warm for long periodsand not well present . the wait staff , apart from one , obviously find the guest to be an add hinderance to their duty as you be eiher ignore . or speak to as they back away from your table as though they have something more important to do . come on Britannia pull your sock up it be embarasse to think that our foreign visitor think that be our 4 star standard . stay at a Premier Inn , far superior ! 	
 Apr 14 2009 	 Definately not four star ! I would not give it one Star . 	 for Valentines Day my partner and I decide to book in to this ' four ' Star hotel after previously stay in a Four Star Hilton the month before . which be amazing by the way ( Hilton Metropole - London).On arrival the Lobby be beautiful , the reception staff ( day ) be grumpy and look at we as if we be scum . we head to the lift which be small and shabby . hall way be decorate relatively nicely . our room need serious updating and as we ask for a non smoking room even though we be smoker , I be suprise to see an ashtray but no opening window . the janitor opende it on request and he be the most pleasant man . Bathroom be lovely . could not get a signal on the tv so nothing to do there . we try to eat in the pizza lounge and bar on two occasion . on both we encontere other guest shout at the manager for bad service and food . the waitor do not write our order down , I tell my partner I would be suprise if he remember , he do not ! come back 15 minute later with ' what be it you want ? ' . 40 minute later we get our food and the pizza look like a burn tesco pizza . the waitor be rude , ignorant and not train . the restaurant have three other couple and seat about 100 people so they be empty and no excuse could be give . the bar staff ignore you so they can carry on their conversation and I be not give cutlery or sauce and when I go to ask all staff have disappear . Cutlery turn up dirty . order our drink and they forget they repeatedly ! ! ! ! I be fume after the second night . the good meal we have be when we walk to Gauchos about 10 minute away . I would never ever stay here again , bad service I have ever encounter , even a smile would have be nice . the cleaner however be very polite . consider the price and the star rating I expect alot more . would have be well in a caravan . location be amazing just a shame they put this hotel there , what a waste ........ 	
 Mar 31 2009 	 Great Hotel Fantastic Location 	 I have stay in this hotel twice with my fiance and we be probably go again later in the year . the hotel itself be lovely , nicely decorate , perfect bedroom and a wonderful bar and lounge overlook the river . Canary Wharf be a fab place to stay as it be outside of the city centre but within easy travel distance ( by dlr and tube ) . the shopping centre be great , with a variety of shop and price ! the hotel staff have always be helpful and accommodate and one actually join we for a drink one evening ! we have stay in London quite a few time and this be by far the good hotel we have stay in . do not be put off by other review and by the outside of the hotel which do no justice to the inside- I gaurantee that you will love it . 	
 Mar 19 2009 	 frequent visitor have enough though 	 it be the 3rd time I go there and I can say I will try to find another hotel next time . this hotel have be leave to time , as no refurbishment have take place over the year . the main reason I have choose it so many time be the location , as it be in a business / stylish area , with access to the new underground line . however clean the room be , the time have leave its mark . I can not expect a room of 284 GBP rate ( indicate at the reception ) to have this kind of facility . please bear in mind that I stay in two different room , due to a short trip I have and both room where in the same bad condition . if you expect internet connection , you should a take a pair of slipper , as you should visit the lounge room ( next to reception ) to connect in the wifi network . there be no wire broandband connection , only wifi , which do not work properly . I can admit that the hotel have a top classic decoration and great view ( to a Thames branch river and O2 ) , however , I be not sure whether you will find this view again after mid 2009 , or 2010 , as a new building will be build very very close to the east side of the hotel ( see more on www.ballymore.co.uk).some photo of the horrible bathroom and main room condition , as well as of the great decoration and view , here : http://img23.imageshack.us / img23/6274 / britannia.jpgi almost forgot : get a portable heater with you , heating be set to Alaska temperature level . 	
 Mar 1 2009 	 good location but not great level of service 	 second time stay here , mainly due to price , availability for go to the O2 . only do room only so can not comment on the food - apart from to say that do not expect to get a hot drink after 11:00pm - not even a cup of hot chocolate be possible apparently . also - anyone who be allergic to caffeine be stuff as they can not do decaffeinate coffee - the alternative offer be herbal tea ! it be all look a bit shabby these day and the decoration be just bizarre - even by normal hotel standard . I have select would recommend to a friend - but note only with suitable warning notice attach ! 	
 Feb 19 2009 	 Bloody awful shabby decor rude staff appal food 	 it all start go wrong at check - in ; after a hard day at work I just want to collapse on my bed for 10 minute before grab a bite to eat and retire for the evening to do some work . I arrive at check - in where some chap start my check in process and half way , without say a word to I disappear never to be see again ! eventually someone else pick up the process and check I in . the decor be shabby throughout , the hotel have motion sensitive light in the corridor that do not work properly leave the public area in semi - darkness ( not a safe feeling for a woman travel alone in London ) ; the door slam loudly and make a horrible racket . the decor in the room be dreadful - no taste , no style - my recommendation - leave the curtain open and focus on the view of Canary Wharf from the window . I do not even want to think about what the stain on the wallpaper in my room be !   there be no sound insulation in this hotel and its very near the Docklands Light Railway so its very noisey with train . the bed be so uncomfortable and squeak loudly if you so much as twitch a finger . the shower be a mixer tap attachment - no power , no way thermostatic control , so you have to twiddle with the tap alternatively freeze and scald yourself under a miserable dribble of water . the ' complimentary ' coffee be more of an insult - I be not sure what brand it be but I do not even think Lidl 's would stock it . as for the food - for heavens sake do not eat here ! you be surround in this area with some fabulous place to eat and this be not one of they . its shockingly poor quality and ridiculously high price . there a Holiday Inn Express not far from here for less per night and less pretention - with that hotel you know what your getting and its reasonable value for money . 	
 Feb 16 2009 	 okay but not what I would call four star ! 	 having read mixed review of the Britannia International , I be a little nervous as to what I would find when I stay there , but overall it be a perfectly acceptable hotel , though I would not rate it four star . I find all of the staff I have dealing with to be nothing but helpful , friendly and knowledgeable . my standard room be well - size , with plenty of storage space ( triple wardrobe , with a trouser press inside , two beside chest of drawer and a dressing table ) , and the three pint ( 1.7 litre ) kettle and teapot be appreciate , though the latter would have be more useful if a tea cosy be provide as well . whilst the room do have air conditioning , it take some time for it to switch from heat to cool after be turn on . I think that the secondary & quot;night light&quot ; in the bathroom be a good idea , though the bathroom be very small , with barely enough room for the washbasin , toilet and bath . the corridor be rather gloomy , as the carpet and wall be in dark colour , as be the door , and there be not much lighting along they . the & quot;double&quot ; bed comprise of two , individually make up , single bed push together beneath a solid wooden headboard . Breakfast be a hit and miss affair , with a single slice conveyor toaster that appear to have setting of & quot;charcoal&quot ; and & quot;warm bread&quot ; , with nothing in between , and which do not eject the toast far enough , so you have to fish around under the toaster with a pair of tong to extract it ... though that could have be a problem with the output & quot;tray&quot ; not be angle correctly . tea and coffee at breakfast come in jug , which be leave on a couple of table for guest to help themselves . as a result , unless you be lucky enough to get a jug as soon as it be bring out , the tea be almost invariably stew . the window in the room be filthy , seemingly not clean for week , and the soundproofing be minimal , with noise pollution from inside the Hotel ( there appear to be a Disco go on the night I stay ) and outside ( the Docklands Light Railway run virtually behind the building , and it be on one of the main road in the area).In addition , use of the Hotel 's Health and Leisure Club be chargeable for everyone , even hotel guest , whereas the majority of similar Hotels I have stay in include use of such facility as part of your stay . finally , there be the price . at the time of writing , the rack rate for a Standard Twin or double room be £ 105 ( room only ) , rise to £ 349 for the Penthouse Suite ( with Breakfast and Dinner ) , and breakfast be £ 10.50 per person for the Continental option , or £ 13.50 per person for the cooked option . in my view , those be excessive for the overall quality of the Hotel , even allow for the size of the room and the location , and I would be unlikely to stay at the Hotel again if there be not a promotional rate available . 	
 Feb 5 2009 	 make our first trip to London very special . 	 my friend and I and my two kid have decide we be go to have a long weekend in London in the summer hol . we want to go to see the Tutinkamoon exhibition , which actually we be disappoint in , but that another story . we decide to travel by train to London as it be the easy and cheap as we book it in advance along with the hotel , London Eye ticket , King Tut exhibition and theatre ticket . we want somewhere that would be easy to get to everywhere we want but really , think it good to be nearer the Dome as we be go to that on the first night and do not want to be travel around London on our first night too far . so that be why we pick this Hotel . we get a great deal . we have a family room and a double room . we find it easy enough to get from Euston station via the tube to Hotel , advice to buy a tube pass either on the train or at Euston . we do not have to pay for my son as he be only 10 , he travel free , if I recollect correctly he may be free at the hotel as part of the deal . anyway the view be gorgeous from our very large family room , we could see the Millenium Dome and it be just lovely . the room be very spacious and beautifully decorate . everything be lovely . we find the staff very helpful , with advice etc . Breakfast be everything you could require and set you up for the day , a drink and small snack be all that be require for lunch so no time be waste in restaurant during the day not to mention money . we would then have a good evening meal . I would highly recommend this hotel , especially if you have something you want to see at the Millenium Dome . we actually walk down with the river Thames from there and to the Greenich tunnel under the Thames which we do not know even exist and then catch a boat trip from Greenich and get off at Tower Bridge . not that centrally locate but if you want central location for hotel you have to pay the price . also if you get the tube 3 day pass you can not travel on the underground during rush hour unless you pay the high price . so if you intend to get anywhere via the tube and be centrally locate you would still have to wait . strangely enough the first morning we be there my daughter 's Geography teacher who be married to her english teacher come in as they be stay there . apparently they go to London every summer holiday and this be a new hotel for they but would definately use it again . 	
 Feb 3 2009 	 Old and Shabby 	 this hotel be a let down - it be book as part of a Superbreaks package for a Christmas present . not ideally locate for travel around the city of London - I expect the rest of the place to make up for this fact , however I be disappoint . parking be available at the hotel but there be no reduction in rate for use it if you be stay in the hotel . at £ 21 it be pretty pricey , as it take a £ 30 + taxi journey to get anywhere or a couple of change of tube ( not ideal for a lone woman)!!On check in the gentleman be nice enough although with his grasp of the english language should not have be put in a reception role . we be give a room that be adequate but very tired looking . the bed be atrocious , it squeak loudly if you do so much as turn a page in your book . the wall be very thin and the cleaner be very noisy after 7am . the second night we eat in the hotel which be extremely average and the service on a level with McDonalds . the barman would circle the service charge on your bill if you buy so much as cola from the bar . in summary - do not book this hotel to stay in unless you absolutely have to . there be plenty of well locate , well value place in London . 	
 Jan 30 2009 	 very good deal 	 I be very impressed with the hotel , actually we be try to get something near Victoria , but the price be either rocket high , or the quality be a trash . some place look really disgusting . we decide for the International Hotel and pay only 60 euro per night in a double room , there be no hidden charge or anything . plus : closeness to Canary Wharf tube - about 15 minute to the downtown . price . personal . negative : we could not open the window and we almost diye during the night , it be so hot and we just coulnd't turn off the heating ; personal in the bar be rather not helpful ; do not even bother pay 2,5 for the welness , it be disgusting and reallly not worth it . I guess the UK people just do not know how to use a sauna and pool . a lot of sweaty people jump to the pool right after they leave sauna - no shower , so if you like swmme in sweat , you be welcome to purchase a ticket . over all , I be very satisfied and definitely would stay there again . 	
 Jan 27 2009 	 would never go back ! ! 	 I stay in this hotel with a group of friend whilst we be in london see a show , so therefore a number of room be book . hotel room be shabby and look like a grandmas living room , although clean , one room have damp in the corner and another have what look like blood spatter on the ceiling . we only have one meal in the hotel , we eat in the pizza place , service be poor , food be burn , cold and some be partially under cook , it take over half an hour to receive our drink and when we complain , the waitress be extremely rude ! ! hotel reception be not much help either . overall , not a good experience ! 	
 Jan 26 2009 	 good hotel in a great location 	 having read review on this site shortly the day before I be due to arrive at the hotel , I experience a little trepidation think about what I might be go to . I be pleased to say I have no problem with this hotel whatsoever and have a very enjoyable stay . first impression be that the hotel be in a good location . the hotel be a five minute walk from the Canary Wharf underground station ( if you cut through some building ) or a ten minute walk around the quay ( if you be unfamiliar with the shortcut ) . the lady who serve I at check - in be polite and friendly and the whole process take less than two minute . on enter the room , rather than a shabby - look 1970 's room as I have be lead to expect , I find a pleasant normal - look hotel room . ok , so maybe some of the furniture , e.g. the wardrobe , be a little worn but the wardrobe be not a major part of a hotel stay ! the room be clean and warm and that be all that matter to I . the room also have air con and , as with other , I do find the room a little too warm at some point and turn down the air con temperature seem to have little effect . kick off the quilt work fine though . the only thing I would say be that the single bed be quite narrow . I work on a ship so I be use to that but there be a few time when I have to grab onto the side of the bed to stop myself from roll out of it!as for breakfast , I never have it and instead choose to go to the nearby Starbucks . I have one evening meal at the Pizzeria and admittedly I be not impressed , so much so that my sister and I eat at the Canary Wharf mall from that point on . our pizza we have seem to be a pre - buy thing with little flavour and our 200ml Coke ( small than a can ) cost £ 2 ! ! ! I do not use the gym or swimming pool , although I have intend to , so can not comment on that . I find the staff at this hotel very polite and friendly , which I be also a little surprised about consider some of the early review . I only observe one incident where a staff member be rude to a guest during my whole stay ( although most people would say one occurence be one too many).Overall though , I would recommend this hotel . it be location , take about fifteen to twenty minute to get into central London by underground , really do make it great value for money , especially if you can get an online offer as we do ( 3 night cost we £ 165 ) . 	
 Jan 25 2009 	 Decent enough 	 stay here for one night while I be attend a concert in the O2 Arena . Hotel be overall very nice and the room be pleasant and comfortable . decent selection of eatery in the hotel . friendly staff . good location for get to and from the O2 Arena - I use hotel organise taxi . 	
 Jan 25 2009 	 Old Britannia 	 both the positive and negative review have the essential right ; this hotel be : 1 ) relatively cheap -- but only if you can get a real bargain . my corporate rate be 138 GBP , which be far too much . 2 ) close to a tube station -- but that tube station ( Canary Wharf ) be in the middle of the dockland . so you be likely a long ride away from anything you come to see in London . 3 ) desperately in need of a renovation . all -- every single piece -- of furniture be tired and chip . the television stand on a very low podium ( see photo ) . if two people sit on the bed to watch tv , the person on the right will not be able to see the tv over the leg of the person on the left . the desk chair have wide gap between the slat ( see photo ) and be woefully uncomfortable . the bathroom be clean , but for a black stain on the bottom of the shower curtain and the fact that the soap dish look like it have be use as an ash tray . the bathroom door lock be miss the cover and a screw ( photo ) . as report , the double bed be two single mattress , which be disconcert even when sleep alone . bottom line : only if you pay next to nothing and even then only if you really want to stay in the Docklands . 	
 Jan 10 2009 	 Nice hotel with good location 	 we stay here for four night in the end of December , and have two double room . the hotel be nice , and have a good location in Canary Wharf . our room be large ( for London standard ) , with a beautiful view to the wharf and the large building in Canary Wharf . the room be fine , but old . the breakfast buffet be ok . for I the hotel be more a 3 star , than a 4 star , but we enjoy the hotel , and we will recommend it if you could find a good rate . 	
 Dec 31 2008 	 great hotel 	 britannia international christmas 2008   we stay in a double deluxe room which be spacious and clean . fantastic view of the warf from the bedroom and also from the bar . drink be cheap in the hotel than surround bar . food plentifull and good.we get the 4 night full board for £ 250 , so be very pleased . tube station miute away . shop , cafe and bar on the doorstep . 	
 Dec 24 2008 	 interesting international 	 my wife and I have just spend 4 night at this hotel and enjoy it . it be very clean . the room be large , have a huge bed , two single join together . nice bathroom . the room be bright with large window , overlook Canary wharf building and former dock water . we could see as far as the Dome across the other side of the Thames in the distance . it must be say that the Docklands Light railway run fairly close by , and be rather noisy the first night until we get use to it , then it do not bother we so much . the main thing we have to get use to be that the room do get very warm , and no matter what the thermostat on the wall be turn down to , it still stay around 25C. still this do not spoil our stay . we do ask at reception for an electric fan and this be do immediately . other request be also deal with speedily by polite and efficient staff , such as another iron , as the one in the room be badly scratch somehow [ yes there be an iron board and iron in the room ] . there be an indoor pool but we do not get a chance to use it .   we go to and from the West end every day as the DLR and Jubilee station be only a short distance away .   although not in the centre of London , we would recommend this hotel if you be not too sensitive to noise -- from outside not in . 	
 Dec 7 2008 	 ok nothing more nothing less just ok 	 a tired hotel in need of rejuvenation ! just return from a long weekend at the International ans it could be a great hotel . its tired and in need of a ot of TLC . room ( furniture / bed / bathroom ) appear to be ' so last century ' but at least be reasonaby clean , just so tired looking . have breakfast on 2 morning and this be perhaps the great let - down for a 4 - star hotel . very small area for a small / poor selecion ( sausage be good though ) , below par for even a 2 - star hotel . atfer 9 it get too busy , not enough coffee / tea , table noet clean ( insufficient staff ? ) . 5 station on tv ( cable / satellite ... no .... ) . Staff be friendly and keep a wild wedding party in check . do have WiFi internet in the room . location be fine , 5 min from Canary Wharf DLR / Jubilee line . Great Resaurant in mall ( Le Plateau ) . anyway not 4 start currently i'ld give it 2 . cos housecleaning try to do our room at 815 on a sunday - morning ! ! ! ! 	
 Nov 25 2008 	 Princes Trust Dinner 	 firstly do not stay at this hotel thank god ! but attend a dinner dance in aid of the Princes Trust . it be so cold in there I can not tell you . it be a black tie do so all the lady wear gown or dress with bear shoulder . my foot be like a block of ice they try to turn the air con off but only make it worst.the food come out which be fine but cold straight away the only thing that make it be it be indian so it be hot and spicey . everywhere from the toilet upstairs or downstairs be freeze . in the foyer some chinese guest be sit there in glove and coat most uncomfortable . have now get a chill and off work that s why I have to write this.also very very dated hotel would not have be happy stay there 	
 Nov 25 2008 	 pleasantly surprised 	 my wife and I have just return from a weekend break in London ( 2 night ) . we pay a total of £ 184 for two night at the International , include return ( Standard Class ) train travel from Nottingham . having see some of the recent review of the hotel ( after we have book ! ) we be somewhat apprehensive about the accommodation . we be pleasantly surpise to find that the hotel meet our need . the room be a good size , clean and well - decorate . the aircon be a bit substandard but quite tolerable . the hotel be in an excellent location , with easy access to good eat facility . we therefore do not make any use of the hotel breakfast / dining / bar facility . to underline our positive view of the place , we have book again for early in the new year . 	
 Nov 21 2008 	 this be not 4 Star!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11 	 book through Superbreak my experience at this hotel be awful . even though the hotel be in the Docklands and a couple of tube from the centre of town , I book it because the picture look fab and the hotel be mean to be 4 star . I book an Executive Room and be really look forward to my theatre break . the show be great . the room be awful . the room be furnish it tired break and chip 1980s furniture , picture break , bathroom dirty , grid over waterjet be break or have pubic hair in they . it be an awful experience . the staff be not very friendly and speak poor English and the swimming pool be tiny compare with the website picture . this be not a four star hotel . 	
 Nov 17 2008 	 think carefully and get it cheap very cheap ! 	 the tag line for this hotel be & quot;strike Modern Hotel situate in popular Docklands area&quot ; . ok so it be in the heart of the dockland but striking and modern ? the initial impression of the hotel as you approach be a large brown looming building that look like some old 80 's office block . the attractive night time shot display on this website be take from across the water . I read somewhere that it be build about 15 year ago but to say that it be modern be a joke ! its very dated internally , think a 1970 's poor attempt at oppulence ! we book through an internet website and get two double room for 65 pound per room . I think this be the limit that you should be look at spending . there be price in the reception state in excess of 200 pound per night but to pay this you would have to be mad . you would then be very angry at yourself for the rest of the stay ! it state that it be a 4 * but more realistically think 2 * . the reception itself be very date - a glimpse at thing to come ! as we check in I notice that nearly everyone else appear to have internet booking . in term of the staff they be friendly and the concierge be very helpful . the bedroom themselves do not appear to have be update since the hotel have be open . they be both reasonably clean however our duvet cover have a small rip in it that at any other establishment you would have expect it to have be repair or replace . for any 6 footer be careful of the low slung chandelier that be precariously position just by the window - beware mild concussion ! the window themselves be dirty on the outside and quite possibly like the interior have not be clean since the opening ! there may have be a good view out there somewhere but it be hard to tell ! as per many other review here the air con do not seem to make any diffrence to the temperature of the room but in late October we be not at all bother . you can hear the dlr late into the night and again early next morning but not so much that it be too intrusive . I suppose this be one of the negative for have it conveniently on your doorstep . we do put our do not disturb sign up as the maid seem to be about from just after 7 but we be not bother right up until we check out just after 11 . we use this hotel as a base to attend a gig at the O2 arena and as such it fit purpose perfectly . with Canary Wharf five minute walk away and the O2 just one subway stop away the positioning of the hotel be perfect . price in the Hotel bar be reasonable for London , just under 3 pound for a bottle of beer . compare it to the pub around the corner where we pay over 4 pound for a pint of beer ! we do not pay for breakfast but instead go to the shopping centre at Canary Wharf and have a lovely meal for alot less money ! in summary , I would use this hotel again if I be go to the O2 but only if I could not find one nearby for about the same money . if you book for less than 80 pound its hard to argue with that price ! do not go expect 4 star it simply be not ! if you be use it for a short stay then give it a go but get it cheap . you be never go to rave to friend about this hotel but hopefully you be go to be talk about the wonderful gig you see at the O2 or your brief visit to merchant London . hopefully this review be helpful to you , all the good ! 	
 Nov 15 2008 	 oh Dear ! go anywhere else 	 10th-14th Nov 08 . I book my stay in this hotel via hotels.com and be give an average price of £ 174 per night . pricey yes but a 4 * in Canary Wharf must be good , right ? well , after press the confim button on the website I find that I have be charge an extra £ 30 per night in & quot;hidden charges&quot ; and there be a 100 % cancelation fee . I need a room for this week so dicide that although I should have cancel the transaction via my credit card provider and find somewhere else it be not worth the effort . how wrong I be . apon arrival at the hotel it be like step back to 1982 , which be when I would guess the last time this hotel be decorate . flowery carpet , badly varnish wood , fake gold and brass everywhere . it be under a delusion that it be grand when in fact the only word that can describe it be Tacky . I book a double but have to demand a different room when confront with 3 single bed instead . even the so call double I be move to be 2 single bed push together . the hotel website offer wireless broadband throughout the hotel which be a lie as this only work in the lobby area and be slow than dial - up . the air conditioning throughout the hotel be awful and even after set mine to its low temp and turn the fan up my room be never below 26 . the Gym be advertise to open till 10 but close at 9 everyday and again have air - conditioning problem so feel like run in a sauna . this seriously over price for the lack of facititie and comfort . avoid this hotel ! 	
 Nov 14 2008 	 the WHORST HOTEL AT CANARY WHARF 	 certainly the bad hotel I have stay in!!!!!!1- they do not have mini bar for a 4 * this be not normal2- the double bed be 2 single bed put together so you have to sleep on one side otherwise you feel the junction and it be very unconfortable3- the decoration be just very hold and the hotel desperatly need a renovation4- breakfast : hot chocolate be do with only water and table be very unclean5- do not look under the sheet of the bed you will find spring box with whole and very dirty .... let us try to find something good to say ..... mmmmmm .... I can not find anything ... tube station be not too far .... the bad hotel in Canary Wharf ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do not stay THERE 	
 Nov 6 2008 	 comfortable clean hotel . 	 book a 3 day 2 night London Spectacular with National Holidays travel from Ashton - Under - Lyne . would recommend this trip to all age wish to visit London . clean coach with a friendly driver . we be drop off at good location in London . the hotel we stay in be the International Britannia situate in the Docklands area of London . the hotel be well situated for underground and dockland light railway also large shopping area . the hotel be very clean the room warm well furnished and spotless . we be on the 9th floor overlook the front of the hotel and could see the london eye in the distance and other site . if you stay in a room face the rear of the hotel overlook the water you do experience noise from the dockland light railway . Tip ask for a room overlook FRONT of hotel . we arrive on 31st Oct and it be bitterly cold weather . the hotel bar area and resturant be cold and a lot of people be sit in coat . the bedroom very warm ind . temp control . we be on bed breakfast and evening meal and these be very good all the food be tasty and hot . I be not really sure what to expect after read other review but I must say we have an enjoyable stay at this hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it . 	
 Nov 2 2008 	 do not stay here ! ! ! 	 well my new husband and I decide to get away for a few day as a mini honeymoon and state this when we book , therefore expect to get some kind of special offer or a free fruit basket but nothing . I get ask if I want to pay for upgrade all the while I be check in . we proceed to our room on the 10th floor after drive for 6 and a half hours(obviously knackere ) and get a nice surprise- our door would not open . so we have to go back to reception and make to feel like we be stupid because they keep ask if we have use the key card right ! ! ! they give we a new key and same happen so think we be just not do it right send somebody up with we . they say they would get it fix before we get back from look around london . few hour later we be tell it be fix but no . we be tell it be a problem with the door and we would be move room but that never happen . we have to get somebody to let we in our room the 2 day we stay which be annoying . the bed be so uncomfortable and the pillow - what pillow ? ? they be so flat it be unbelievable so have to use the spare aswel as those!the staff be so unhelpful , they do not smile once throughout our stay and when we order room service they sigh all the way through our order and just frankly could not be bother . we ask for french fry with a burger and an extra portion so we receive burger and crisp ! and no extra fry , we be too tired to argue though as walk around london on and off tube do tire you out and I m 5 month pregnant ! when we check out we do not even get a goodbye ! and £ 42 for parking be ridiculous ! how this hotel be still open be beyond I ! never stay again ! 	
 Oct 17 2008 	 not good 	 stay at this hotel about 3 year ago and would have recommend it then . don't know what have happen since , but I will not be stay again , most other review have already say it all- hard bed , poor breakfast , in general need of an overhall . if you stay have your breakfast early otherwise the self service area get over crowded . they do not have feedback forms- which say something to I . the only plus be that it be within Docklands- which may suit if visit the commercial centre . 	
 Oct 17 2008 	 name be not enough 	 I stay 4 night at the Britannia near Canary Worth for business and will definitely never go back . the decor , furniture and facility be really appalling for the hotel standard : no safe , no minibar , no alarm clock , no wi - fi , loss of water pressure , poor AC ( 28c in room ) . all of this be ok for simple leisure hotel / B&amp;Bs , but the hotel aim at the business market and you pay for it ( & gt;120gbp).but the final straw come with the bill : I be charge for a breakfast I never take ( £ 14 ) , pay £ 4 for a soft drink at the bar and ... £ 50 for a 12min - phone call ( to Europe ) . rip - off ! 	
 Oct 6 2008 	 date decor and uncomfortable bed but not terrible . 	 we stay here as part of a competition prize for two night during the week , and be upgrade to a jacuzzi room . the room itself be large and comfortable with good furnishing and a share balcony as well as the well feature bathroom with spa bath . the room , ( actually on the 12th floor ) be actually access via a small private staircase from the 11th floor , which may be an issue for those with mobility difficulty but provide an additional measure of privacy and isolation from the main corridor , there be a connect door to an adjoining room but this be securely lock and presumably can be unlocked to create a large suite of the two room . the décor throughout be in good condition , but outdate - a rather chintz combination of pattern on the wallpaper and carpet in all area , although the corridor show some sign of refurbishment . Breakfast be serve in the restaurant , and be hot , fresh plentiful and have a good range available . 'spindle ' , the health club within the hotel be available to guest for an additional charge , be clean and seem well run , the pool be small but adequate and the spa , steam room & amp ; sauna be all fine . the hotel advertise WiFi availability in public area , and this be available and provide a fast and reliable service in the bar and lounge , and be popular with several user at most time of the day . there be a signal available in the room on the upper floor , but we be unable to use this despite the computer be able to connect . unfortunately , there be element that detract from the stay - the bed be a double as advertise ( rather than the ' two single zip together ' mention by other reviewer ) , but be uncomfortable and could be noisy lead to a poor night of sleep . the air condition be also not function , although the in room fan be work prove an element of air circulation if not cool . overnight the balcony door could be open for additional cooling , but the Docklands Light Railway run past the front of the hotel and start operate sometime before 6 am and be noisy . the spa bath in the room work well , and have an integrated shower , which be low on power but adequate to clean oneself . the staff be friendly , helpful and professional at all time , with a competent concierge service available as well . the hotel have good transport link and be a very short walk from both DLR and London Underground station provide rapid link into the centre of London and the rest of the Docklands area . the hotel do have a car park , but this also have an additional charge . 	
 Sep 20 2008 	 Poor Quality 	 I stay here one night with a group of colleague and this hotel really need to go back to the basic . check in staff do not tell I breakfast time or where the restaurant be . the receptionist also seem confused about the booking . bad , however , be to follow . although my room be a bit faded , the main problem be the lack of air conditioning . despite this be September in London , the temperature in my room be 26.5C. apparently , the air conditioning in this hotel have not work for some time ! all I could do be to get the window open and ask for a fan , which turn out to be quite small . once the window be open in this hotel , traffic noise be loud , especially from the Docks Railway . other complaint - my bed be hard and uncomfortable and the buffet evening meal mean cold gammon and cool vegetable . at breakfast , one of my colleague find a long black hair in the mushroom . our lunch that day be so poor , I could only eat some salad and a roll . if you do not have to stay here , look for an alternative . 	
 Aug 27 2008 	 I and my husband never come back to this hotel again 	 the only thing I and my husband like about this hotel it be just the view from on our room but the room quality , service , staff attitude , and the food be poor and the room it be not modern at all . the money we have to pay for the room be expensive for what it be , we think this hotel should be 2 star not 4 star . 	
 Aug 27 2008 	 not so good .... 	 in common with most of the other review I be disappoint with the overall condition of the room . poorly appoint bathroom , terrible bed , non function aircon and a lack of interest by the reception staff . and the noise .... to get anywhere near cool ( even in this bad summer ) I have to force the window open and then it be too noisy to sleep . your choice - you can be boil alive all night or keep awake by the general city din . Buffet be ok and actually quite good value and the bar be good . breakfast be standard help yourself fare , ok but nothing special . there be well budget hotel in the area . 	
 Aug 22 2008 	 avoid - bad stay of MY life ! ! ! 	 my wife and I stay here for 2 night and be absolutely shocked at the condition of the hotel , attitude of the staff and the cleanliness of the room . our room have nightstand with broken handle , the tv stand be break . upon get into bed we find hair in the bed , I do not think they clean the room much . we also have ask for a 6 am wake up call as we have an appointment set up for the follow morning which we never get . the night before we depart we inquire about the & quot;flat - fee&quot ; taxi to heathrow , which we be tell need to be book before 11 pm . upon return from dinner ( about 9 pm ) we go to the front desk and book the taxi for 8 am , and a wake up call ( which work this time ) . the follow morning upon go down to the lobby the door man come over to we and tell we our taxi be ready and take our bag and put they into the car . upon arrival at the airport we be tell that this cab be not a flat fee taxi , and cost significantly more that the flat fee . I have since call the hotel to understand what happen and they have basically say that I do not book the taxi . the people over the phone make snide remark that I must not stay in alot of hotel and flat out tell I that it be my error , a simple apology would have suffice . I find this extremely frustrating . as it happen I stay at alot of hotel on business , but I have never stay at a hotel quite this bad . I have no idea as to how they claim to have 4 star , I have stay at well 2 - star establishment . 	
 Aug 6 2008 	 okay for Business Travellers 	 stay at the International for 2 night on business in Docklands . August 2008.check in fast and welcoming . staff friendlyroom be comfortable and generally clean , but like other reviewer the room would benefit from a little tlc to spruce they up . nevertheless all the requirement I need be provide , trouser press , tea / coffee making , tv etc . would have like breakfast include at £ 105 per night . so do not try breakfast at £ 13.50 but find a great deli in Harbour Exchange Square ( Bacon sandwich & amp ; coffee £ 2.90 ! ) overall for the business traveller need a reasonable base in Docklands the International would be satisfactory . 	
 Aug 5 2008 	 love this hotel 	 after read the review on this hotel I be a bit worried about what to expect , but after stay there 1st & amp ; 2nd August 08 , I come to the conclusion that the reviewer must have have an exceptionally bad experience . I only pay £ 99 per person which include breakfast and transport to and from the south coast . the room be quite large with a fantastic view of canary wharf and the O2 Dome ( 8th Floor ) , it be clean and have everything that you could need for a short break . the air conditioning work fine , we keep it on during the day which make the room nice and cool and turn it off at night . after go round the Canary Wharf museum on the first afternoon we decide to eat in the hotel and use the buffet / carvery which we think be £ 15.00 . the starter include soup , smoke salmon , mussel , smoke fish , ham , cheese and a load of salad and bread roll , the main be carve beef , chicken in BBQ sauce and salmon in a cream sauce with many veg and the roast potato be actually crispy . the sweet be plentiful and then we have a nice plate of cheese and biscuit . when I go to pay it be only £ 12.50 which be very good for a 4 * hotel in London . I do not think I would have it every night but for what it be it be very good . the buffet breakfast the next morning be also very good with most thing you would expect from a hotel breakfast , in ample quantity and quality . all the staff be very friendly and helpful at all time and the bar have a happy hour between 7 - 8 o'clock . the tube be about 5 min walk but we use the river boat hopper which be about 8mins walk and take you into central London , we return on the 12.40 early on the Sunday morning after go to a show . from my experience I would without doubt stay here again . we be a party of 4 , 2 be in mid 40 's and 2 be pensioner . 	
 Aug 2 2008 	 do not stay here 	 ok hotel if it be not for the terrible bed . all the mattress be lumpy , hard and wear out . my husband and I spend four sleepless night here . we ask to upgrade and pay for it , but they say all the room have the same bed , even the suite . so do your back a favour and do not stay here ! 	
 Jul 25 2008 	 Terrible Hotel 	 Shabby room , shabby service , shabby food ! ! ! only thing go for it be the location , we shall never be stay there again and it be not that cheap!!!Claire 	
 Jul 12 2008 	 poor value for money 	 a rubbish hotel . live off its location close to the heart of Canary wharf . it mop up business traveller like I without try too hard . I'm guess the decor be instal during the heyday of the rapid rise of the area , when tacky faux gold plate everything would have be consider opulent . the flock wall paper and the vomit induce carpet look like they have be dream up during one of Oscar wilde more camp moment . the room be shabby . the staff be , however , polite and efficient . I pay GBP239 for a basic double room . a thoroughly ridiculous price for a poor hotel . 	
 Jul 10 2008 	 great hotel 	 the hotel be excellent . I go there in July 2005 with my sister . it be not our option , but we be remove because our original hotel be close to the subway station blow in a terrorist attack . the hotel receive we perfectly . very efficient check - in and check - out . the only problem be : a ) if we want to make a phone call we should leave a guarantee in the amount of GBP 750 , as well to use the safe box ; b ) the continental breakfast , although very clean , have a bad taste : you should choose the british breakfast to eat well . the hotel be far from center but half a mile from a huge commercial center and from train / subway station . generally , be an excellent choice . 	
 Jun 29 2008 	 truly awful hotel 	 this be one of the bad hotel I have ever have the misfortune to stay in . it be only about 15 year old but it be in terrible condition . the air conditioning in the first room I be offer do not work ; after speak with the manager I be offer an upgrade to a slightly cool room . however , chat to the concierge I find out that the air conditioning in the hotel just can not cope when it be busy . top tip : get a room with an easterly view so that you do not get the sun heat up the room in the evening . the bed have a mattress that be ruin , and the cover be stain . overall the room be not very clean and it be a depressing place to spend any time in . this hotel be cheap but other budget hotel offer a far superior product . 	
 Jun 17 2008 	 nice hotel comfortable bed in ok location 	 Hotel be nice , clean and have lovely view of Canary Wharf . if you be visit London from outside UK , I would not reccommend it as you will have to find local tube link and at night this could be difficult . it be nice to stay near Christmas as it be close to the Canary Wharf Ice rink . hotel itself be comfort and plesant . I would not pay more than £ 80 a night though , as you can get well hotel in the Centre of the West end . 	
 Jun 13 2008 	 Great Location for O2 Arena 	 look for hotel as be attend an event at the O2 Arena and find the Britannia International Hotel on hotelstayuk.com . the rate be highly competitive , the location be great and it come highly recommended!Will book again . 	
 May 29 2008 	 would recommend for weekend break ... 	 I stay in this hotel for a weekend and find it lovely , great tube network from city centre with 2 tube within 4 min walk of hotel .. Room have balcony with great view of river and Millenium Dome .. the only drawback be that there be nothing around the hotel , it be in an office district , but over the bridge into the Canary Wharf you will find lot of restaurant and shop , the only bar nearby be the hotel bar itself which be very basic , but the seating be comfortable with big sofas overlook the river , as I be travel alone it be nice to go down in evening and feel comfortable sit in the bar on a sofa reading .. the restaurant be not great in hotel ... breakfast finish early enough , and the buffet dinner at night be not great for the money pay , the italian restaurant be a a bit poor with presentation , on a positive note this hotel be clean spacious friendly and only 10 min from city centre .. I would stay again and would recommend it as a base to anyone who want to go into city for day and come back and chill at night.once you not look for anything wild it be a good clean safe base in London 	
 May 23 2008 	 do not stay here 	 Hotel be very dated and need an overhaul . a / C do not work in our room , and we be upgrade to a very slightly large room where the a?c also do not work . Decor be stripey wallpaper and garish carpet . in - room hairdryer rubbish . Shower be fall off the bracket , and put out around a dribble a week . Staff do not appear to care at all , apart from the time where they be take your money . bar have no snack / crisp at all , which be a minor issue - but as the hotel be handy for the O2 arena , after a concert a beer and some snack be a good thing . the next morning the housekeeping lady knock on our room door four time between 7:15am and 9:00am look to get in to clean . the housekeeping and room service trolley be park outside our room and the noise be awful . I would never , ever stay here again , and certainly would not recommend it to anyoane . need gutte , re - furbed and start again . 	
 May 17 2008 	 Excellent 	 Excellent . book online and get a fantastic deal , upgrade to an executive room on arrival for a very reasonable fee . fantastic view , fantastic service . shame pay guest have to pay for the car park when there be virtually no street parking in the local area . 	
 May 13 2008 	 location be pretty well all this have 	 Lobby be ok and be quiet when I check in mid afternoon for 3 night . I think I have upgrade to an executive double but the bed be dreadful - spring pop every time you move and poke into you , my husband 's foot be several inch over the end of the bed . the furniture be date and look in dire need of a refurb . this hotel be on lastminute.com as a 4 star . the breakfast be like a poor canteen standard . I ask for a river view and get a great one on 9th floor but the DLR be very noisy - the only thing that would ever take I back be the great location for Canary Wharf Jubilee line and DLR . we only sample breakfast once and then find alternative along the bank of the river - much more pleasant ! 	
 Apr 23 2008 	 okay but nothing special 	 stay on business for two night , I have be here before and know of place to go nearby for food and drink etc and be happy to stay again . the reception area of the hotel be very nice , comfortable and clean . the room ( a standard double ) be fine , but the air con seem to be stick and force out hot air , make the first night stay hot and uncomfortable . I report this to the reception where they advise I that they be aware of the problem and offer to open the window for fresh air . this cool the room down but then you get the problem of the noise from Docklands Light Railway train from about 5:30 . also if reception be aware of the problem , why have it not be fixed?breakfast be pretty standard fare , cook or continental buffet and serve its purpose without be great . there be plus point for the hotel , car parking be £ 15 per night , it be only 5 min walk from the Jubiliee Line and DLR to get you into central London . there be a selection of shop bar etc on Canary Wharf , 5 min walk , and drive to the hotel be fairly stress free and outside of the London congestion charge . it be fine for a couple of night , however do not go expect fantastic luxury or fine dining . 	
 Apr 4 2008 	 it be great - can not believe it be the same place describe in the other review 	 I return from here yesterday after a business trip . I do not choose the hotel and when I read the review beforehand , I be horrified and expect it to be awful and that I would probably need to move hotel . I could not have be more wrong . maybe I be just lucky and get a decent room ( 634)?so ... a balanced review of my stay . check - in be swift ( although my colleague report that the front desk be slow and there be some confusion about their booking ) and hassle - free . the lobby of the hotel be pretty grand - chandelier , marble table , vase and stuff , with a bar with view over the water . the room be above average size . very clean , comfortable . it be not decorate in a modern style , but it be definitely not dirty or shabby or fade . the bathroom be tile / marble effect ; again very clean and a reasonable size . the bed be 2 single bed push together , although I sleep across both of they and do not have a problem with the divide ( which I have do in other place where bed have be push together ) . the room be hot , very hot and the window be non - opening . the aircon do not seem responsive , although , to be fair , I do not try query this with any member of staff . I hate hot room and can not generally sleep in one , but it do seem to calm down at night and I be out like a light , so not the problem I expect it to be . my room face towards the dome and over the dlr track . I could hear the train go past , but they be not particularly intrusive , they run less frequently during the night , and they certainly do not keep I awake ( and I be not a good sleeper ) . Breakfast ( if you choose that option ) be serve overlook the water . it be a buffet which be not the most extensive I have come across but certainly more than adequate . tea , coffee , cereal , bread , cold meat , cheese , juice , fruit , and a selection of cooked item . I do not have any of the cook item but they looked nicely cook and do tempt I . check - out be again quick and easy , as be pay for parking . the hotel be well locate . 5 minute ' walk get you to Canary Wharf station , which connect with the wide London transport network via the Jubilee Line and the DLR . despite be fairly central and in a busy area , it be quiet during the night . I go expect bad , bad thing and be more than pleasantly surprised . if I have pay with my own money for it and go for pleasure rather than business I would also have be more than happy with it . so I do not know if mine be just an isolated happy experience , but I would like to give some comfort that my time there do not reflect the critical review on here . hope that help ! 	
 Mar 14 2008 	 it be okay 	 the room be a little scary with too many haunt picture hang on the wall . the shower be the problem that I have to spend several minute adjust to the right temperature . the A / c vent sometimes make some noise . no fridge in our room tho . the good be the location and give the room be clean I would give it 2 star , otherwise 1 star for its price . 	
 Mar 3 2008 	 go for a ymca 	 I stay here on a business trip for 5 day after not be able to get my usual hotel . the business travel department tell I that there have be may complaint and problem about this hotel . I can hear you say well why do you stay there ? ? ? well foolishly I think that it can not be that bad ... its by Canary Wharf so it must be half decent . how wrong I be . firstly I have problem check in because the concept of charge everything back to my company account be alien to they . I be then speak to like a 2 year old as they explain to I how much I be allow to spend each night - all of which I find quite rude . I be force to discuss my room charge everytime I order something which get right on my .... when I eventually get upstairs , all I want to do be sleep . I walk into the room and it be like walk into a Blackpool B&amp;B. the gaudy and tired interior be depress as be the tv . four channel , 2 of which where the same one and channel 5 be stick on a frozen picture for 2 day .... well I do not miss much when it do come back on anyway . the bed be like sleep on a park bench . the spring where completely go on both of the single bed which have be push together . I be force to sleep on the top of the bed , in the hope that the polyester quilt would soften the bed but it just make my hair go static . I order breakfast which I have read in another review be a complete rip off ... and I agree . it again be back to the B&amp;B breakfast of a tiny glass of orange juice , 2 piece of toast and a fudge ( be suppose to be fruit ) yoghurt , all for the grand price of £ 13.50 . nice one . the meal in general where bad , microwave rice , rock hard garlic bread , dirty look chicken ... £ 3.00 for just over half a pint of diet coke . the only thing that keep I sane in the hotel be the pool . its quite small - 4 stroke and you re there .... but it be one way of stay out of the room . please if you be read this - go and stay somewhere else ... someone need to shut this hotel down , do it up and start again . its old and dirty and just lack the basic which you can get in a new cheap hotel . do not waste your money . 	
 Feb 26 2008 	 Nice hotel at a reasonable price 	 after read the trip advisor article , my expectation be low but l find this hotel to be very pleasant . l would rate it a 3.5star . the room have an antique style decoration which l like & amp ; the location be excellent for get to and from central London without pay London price . Canary Wharf be a new part of London but peaceful & amp ; safe from the intense crowd . l particularly think the gym be the good l have see in a hotel . the free weight be a little old but the running equipment , pool , spa & amp ; layout of the gym be big and refreshing . the staff there be lovely & amp ; chatty.l only order a hote chocolate & amp ; dessert from room service but love that the hot chocolate come in a pot and be actually hot when it arrive to my room . l do not have breakfast there as it be nice to walk to Canary Wharf Square . my main negative be the shower in my room . l could not get the temperature right & amp ; the water pressure be weak . however , the shower in the gym downstairs be very good . 	
 Feb 24 2008 	 Horrid ! 	 the Britannia in canary wharf be seriously in need of a decoration it feel like it be last decorate in 1950 , my room be awful and come with strong sewage smell . need I say more ... 	
 Feb 13 2008 	 still hideous 	 I last have the misfortune to stay at the Britannia almost 18 month ago and think ( naively perhaps ) that the varied and numerous problem at the hotel would have be address . how wrong I be . problem start at check in when the gentleman man reception could not work out the prepaid booking I have make to avoid the usual lengthy check in and check out . even this be beyond he and 15 minute later he have to call in his manager to sort the problem out . on the plus side the room be clean . on the downside they be in need of redecoration with old fitting , peel wallpaper and worn carpet . the room be also rather old fashion with plenty of dark wood and a wonderfully kitch chandelier . presumably this be the height of decorative opulence in the early 1980 's but it be now more reminiscent of a Blackpool B&amp;B that be try too hard . the bed be akin to sleep on cobblestone cover with a thin layer of cloth . the double bed be actually make up of two mattress so there be the additional pain of a hard ridge run through the middle of the bed . God forbid I should actually try to roll over during the night without run the risk of break my spine . add to this utter misery be my misfortune at be put in a room overlook the water . I understand these room command a premium although I be not entirely sure how a view of the Docklands Light Railway and a building site be worth the extra cash . the DLR run from early in the morning until late at night and be very , very noisy . the sound proof in general be non - existent . at one point I think I be on the set of Crossroads as my headboard wobble when the room next door close their door . I could also hear every grunt , groan and splash of my neighbour 's early morning bowel movement . even though my stay be at my company 's expense , I refuse to pay the absolutely extortionate £ 13.50 for breakfast . do so would only encourage the hotel , especially as their profit margin do not seem to be go into the hotel itself . please do not make the mistake I do . my positive outlook and willingness to forgive be horribly abuse by the Britannia International . frankly , I feel violate . I have stay in more comfortable one man tent . even though the location be so convenient for Canary Wharf , there be DLR stop within a couple of minute walk from Ibis , Novotel and Marriot hotel . I would not hesitate to choose these over the Britannia . 	
 Feb 4 2008 	 not recommend 	 upon check in , they offer to upsell we to a more expensive room with complimentary breakfast ( which be a rip off at 13.50gbp ) . I go for it , and we find ourselves on the 11th floor in a room which , once you enter the room you must climb a spiral staircase to get to the actual room . the room be huge by London standard and have a balcony . unfortunately , the first day while lie in bed get over some jet lag , I hear some guy yell on the phone , presumably from a nearby room , use obscene language . it go on for some time . also , we have the smell of greasy cook in our room ( on the 11th floor ! ) in the morning . the breakfast be fair , but not great . the front desk be unable to even provide I with antacid when we return in the evening , and they tell we there be no store open at that hour either . in the States , even basic hotel can at least sell you a roll of antacid . we would not stay in this hotel again , though we like the area . if you use a calling card ( the only reasonable way to make international call ) dial ' 9 ' for an outside line , not the code list on the card by the phone . if you dial ' 9 ' , you will not be charge for the toll - free call ; otherwise it be 2 quid . 	
 Jan 25 2008 	 never again -- would never recommend 	 we stay for 6 night a few week ago at this hotel . the only reason we stay be because the hotel where we be could not accomdate all of our party and this be in the budget of the division pay our expense . we be on a business trip and the fund be come out of the global budget . trust I --- none of our senior management would stay in this hotel voluntarily . our problem start with reception . the girl check we in have terrible communication skill and it take FOREVER . our rate be different that what our agency be quote , by that time we be all tired and just want to rest up before dinner . it look like it may have be a nice hotel in it be day , but it need a serious refurbishing and overhaul . everything be old , worn , saggy , peel wallpaper , etc . it be overly decorate with heavy , ornate , dusty fixture , wallpaper , threadbare carpet . the hallway be dark , etc . the only plus be the size of the room and bathroom , which be both generous . oh , one other plus be it be location to our office , which be nice , in walk distance . no alarm clock , bed be two twin push together with sag mattress . very noisy at night , loud noise come from the room on either side of I ( bathroom pipe , etc.).We finally escape to the Hilton Canary Wharf , which be a breath of fresh air ! ! ! ! beautiful hotel . seriously , for 140 pound a night the hotel should be ashamed of itself --- spend some of that on updating ! ! ! 	
 Jan 4 2008 	 Musty ! no other word for it ! 	 well we book this on expedia , see the review but as it be last minute think that we would risk it , but I have to say that all the review be spot on , this place be very old and very musty . my first impression from the outside be that it look quite nice , but inside completely different story ! upon check in we be amazed at the amount of brass and ugly statue everywhere , remind I of somewhere which would have be grand thirty year ago but be now pass its sell by date . we be tell that our booking could not be find on their system and the guy that be deal with we look and sound like he do not want to be there . room be very old in decor- great view of the 02 dome and canary wharf and that be about it ! light in the hallway come on as you walk , feel like I be stay at the shine hotel . do not stay here if you can help it . shame because canary wharf be a really nice area which nice shop locally and good acesss to jubillee line to central london . 	
 Dec 12 2007 	 look like good value but it be not 	 a smart - look 4 - star fifteen minute from central London at half the rate of other ? do not be mislead : the rate be soft here for a reason . the location be ok if you be do business in Docklands ( and you work for a firm with a tight travel policy ) but otherwise you would not want to be here . none of the traditional sight of London be within walk distance , the taxi ride be long and the tube cram with commuter most of the day . the ironic thing be that half the money in England be within a mile of this place , site as it be in the heart of London 's new business centre . with a decent product , this hotel could charge whatever it want . yet the Britannia suffer badly from under - investment . the bathroom and the bedroom be the only old - fashioned thing leave in Docklands and the whole place be look a bit 1990 . some of the investment need not be huge : how much would it cost to clean the lift of graffiti , or to replace the bulb in they so they be not so gloomy?there be several well hotel in Docklands and many more appealing four - star in London . I would stay elsewhere , even if it mean pay more . 	
 Nov 26 2007 	 Fine for a overnight stay follow a concert but not for a holiday ! 	 we book this hotel as we be go to a concert at the O2 and want a hotel nearer the O2 rather than the middle of London . we be not disappoint with the location . the hotel be one stop away from the O2 and be in walk distance of both Canary Wharf ( Jubilee Line ) and South Quay ( dlr).our room overlook Canary Wharf and the water and be very quiet as well as be very picturesque at night . as it be a very late booking when we arrive we find out that the people we book with have not notify the hotel ! the man serve we at reception be extremely helpful and even upgrade the two room we have book and move they so they be adjoining as he have keep we wait ( it be not a very long wait by the way)!Our friend make use of one of the many comfy sofas in the reception area whilst they be wait for we to check in . he be absolutely fantastic and I wish I would make a note of his name so I could write to the management praise he . as we arrive there just before the concert door open we do not have time to eat there , visit the bar or use the pool so I can not comment about they . our room be fine size wise , however they be decorate and furnish in a very old fashioned style use faux antique ... why ? ? the hotel be in the middle of a very modern part of London why do not they not make the interior modern??our bed be comfy ( we have room 710 ) and I have a perfect night sleep and the room be very clean and tidy . even though there be only 1 pillow on each bed , as usual , there be extra one in the wardrobe . the heating in our room work very well and it be plenty warm enough for we when we return from the concert . the bathroom , however , be a let down though . it be clean and the shower and bath function very well as do the hot water , but there be some crake wall tile near the floor opposite the toilet and it just all feel a bit old and in need of replacement . we then leave the next morning without have breakfast as we do not want to pay £ 13.50 each for it!we pay £ 99 for each room which I do not think be too bad for a room in London at very short notice , but I would have be dissatisfied with the hotel have I pay more . the Britannia International do exactly what we want it to which be somewhere to shower and put our head down for the night . I would book this hotel if you want somewhere to stay after a concert at the O2 it be perfect , but if you be go on holiday to London then I really would stay somewhere else as it be neither in a tourist area or a hotel you would want to spend a lot of time in . 	
 Nov 18 2007 	 one night enough 	 I stay at the International 6 year ago and due to the location book again for a weekend break recently . with just one stop to the O2 it be perfect for a concert break . however , I have expect the decor to have change as it be date when I last visiste ! the bed be uncomfortable with spring come through , the wall be paper thin and even the card entry system be give up ( it take we 3 card change and a porter force the door open to get into the room - not what you want just after check in).The bar be convenient and reasonably price although the beer be flat and wine choice poor . 	
 Nov 10 2007 	 tired 	 I have to stay at this hotel regularly as the company book it . if I be pay I would stay else where . it be a clean enough hotel but it be very tired and wear at the edge . the staff be helpfull enough . food wise Jennys carvery be a good deal with a nice selection . if you can get it for under £ 100 then it be a good deal but the advertised price be too high . and the towel smell of vinegar and the tv have fuzzy picture and about 6 channel . over all fine for a night or 2 if on business . 	
 Nov 8 2007 	 not bad really 	 I stay at the Brit a couple of time a month . the hotel itself must of be around for a while and the interior be a little old school . the staff be very helpful , the room be very nice , always clean and nicely make up . room service be good , and the bar be very handy , it also have a gym , never use it myself . on the whole a good hotel for a couple of night in london , handy for the jubilee line and the DLR , your also right on the doorstep of canada square and lot of bar and restaurant . always ask for a room above the 8th floor if you want reliable internet access , always ask for a room face the road if you do not want to be keep awake by the DLR , or wake up by the building site next door . 	
 Nov 4 2007 	 good base for what we need 	 after read the review on this website I be dread stay here . it be my 40th birthday combine with go to watch man utd play arsenal on the sat . stay for two night , do not have any problem with rude staff everyone be polite . food be ok we eat in the pizza place and the meal be fine . the bar be a bit expensive but it be london . the good thing about hotel be location . right next to Canary Wharf with shop bar restaurant all on your doorstep . we get a all day tube pass and go all over london it be excellent .. on the saturday night we go up to the west end to see a show and get back after be just as easy think last tube be 12.15 back to canary wharf but there be night bus . felt really safe in canary wharf as they have 24 hour security . the hotel room be fine , bit of a problem with lack of hot water but this be sort straight away , room be a bit date but we only sleep in our . bed be comfy , do not let review of this hotel put you off , if you do not want to be in central london but still want bar and restaurant this hotel be a great find , will use it again if we go to concert at O2 	
 Oct 28 2007 	 Location be top but overall average 	 my second visit to Britannia International hotel , this time a spur - of - the - moment thing . Didn't think they have parking , so be intend to park on Byng Street ( just a 30 sec walk away with no restriction parking over the weekend ) . but they do have limit underground parking , £ 15 overnight , which I can somewhat except for the city , except that expire at 9 am after which its 3 quid an hour . check - in no problem . like other reviewer , I too have problem with the room card key , and other guest too who resort to call a staff member for help . my first visit I be fortunate to get the river / Canary Whalf view , which be an extremely attractive feature of this hotel , but disappointingly this time we be face the street side . not sure if you can , but I would certainly recommend ask for the river view . room have a nice warming feeling with all the usual facility , but the tv channel be limit - just Ch1 - 5 , Sky News , and something else . there be free wireless Internet , which be a bonus if you have bring your own wireless device . choice of three restaurant , nice lounge area with nice settee overlook the river . there be leisure facility on - site , but I do not use or look at they . rather disappointing experience at breakfast next morning . I be Room only and want to pay for breakfast as an extra . go down to the main breakfast restaurant , be ask if I want Continental or full English . opt for a Continental , so be redirect to the restaurant next door . in there be basically two choice of cereal - Rice Crispies and Corn Flakes , a basket of bread , and Tea / Coffee . all the available table have no cup on they , so could not get a Tea / Coffee . waiter be wander around not actually help . so think sod this , go back next door to upgrade to full English and explain the problem . be tell I could have my Continental in this room alongside the full English ( why I could not in the first place , I do not know ) . then have the full selection of Continental item that you would expect and more ! so feel they try to fob I off with a cheap lousy service . what I love about this hotel:- Location . perfect for explore Canary Whalf area . dlr station just down the road . safe feeling area.- the view , if you can get it.- the free internet access get my vote.- the free paper , magazine , and journal scatter around . what I hate about this hotel:- nothing really ! one or two disappointment , but nothing to complain about . 	
 Oct 25 2007 	 would never have stay here on my own money 	 I stay at this hotel in Sep 07 as it be a highly convenient location for work at Canary Wharf . at £ 160 a night for a double room it be very poor value for money though . bad : the bed be not comfortable . Spongey mattress , flat pillow . LOUD LOUD LOUD . I have be here before and get a room face the DLR which groan and creak loudly into the night and early in the morning . impossible to ignore . this time I ask for a quiet room , and get one face away from the DLR , however , the noise of the high volume air - conditioning on the roof of the building below be really really loud . I mean , I check about 6 time that the window be not open . traffic noise also come through strongly . I would bring some earplug in case , but they be not up to it . telly only have about 5 channel and be not tune in or setup well . there be no safe in the room . find this staggering . valuable ( eg . passport ) would have to be store at reception , and as other people have note , the staff down there be not exactly snappy so it would be quite a pain to have to check - in your stuff with they all the time . Keycard for the door only work in 1 of 15 swipe . I go down and get a new one , and it be just as bad . check - in seem to take an eternity , with several go into the backroom . while I be check in , another couple of gentleman also seem to be have difficulty because their room have be reserve through work , and the staff could not seem to find the reservation . good : the curtain be black - out so at least it be dark and loud . the room be clean , if a little worn . facility like ironing , trouser press and so on present . convenient for Canada Square / Canary Wharf , but its actually a long walk than you think because you have to walk quite a way to get to a bridge . Staff do not seem rude , as other people have say , but be a bit slow / inefficient . as the room be pay for I be fine , but I could not stay there again because its just so ridiculously noisy . 	
 Oct 5 2007 	 not as bad as I expect but not great either ... 	 my company book I into this hotel for 3 night this month ( October ) . after read review on here , I be prepare for the bad . maybe that be why my view on this hotel be not as strong as some . indeed , although there be some problem , all in all I still do not think it be awful . maybe it be also because I could claim all the money back on expense ... first of all , let I tell you this be very much a business hotel , and be not suitable for tourist mainly because of its location in the middle of office building . that be unless you be go to a concert at the Millennium dome ( or O2 Arena as it be call these day ) . it be only 1 stop on the dlr then 1 stop on the tube ( Jubilee line to North Greenwich).I check in just before 2 pm and it be pretty quick . reception staff be polite too ( this time round anyway ) . come up to my room and it be big ( for London anyway ) and fairly clean . tv 's get the usual terrestrial channel plus Sky sport , Sky news and ITV3 . bathroom again fine size with powerful enough shower . the only thing I do not like be the bed which really be very uncomfortable : you could feel every spring when lie down on the mattress , and the pillow be as hard as brick!Anyway , later on I check my bill . I turn out they hard charge I on the first day for all the night , and they have charge I £ 455 instead of £ 315 . so I go back down to reception and be refund the £ 140 difference . just wish they would apologize but there you go . lucky I notice , because that be quite a big difference in cost . I have all my meal at the hotel , simply because at this time of the year when it get dark early and after a long day work I do not feel like go out . the choice around the hotel be quite poor as well . even though you be 10mins walk from Canary Wharf , all there be there be either sandwich place and shop , or restaurant that be too expensive . so the first evening I have dinner at the french - style restaurant . the food be ok , but even though the restaurant be half - empty I have to wait nearly an hour and a half to be serve my bit of chicken with cherry tomato ! as I be on my own as well I be very bored , and by then I be so hungry that I eat everything there be for I to eat : 2 small bread with butter on the side plate ! other people in the restaurant complain as well . as soon as I finish eat it I just leave my table and ask to pay and go . that be when I finally get an apology . there be two other restaurant at the hotel . a buffet one which be fine for the price ( plus as it be buffet you do not have to wait to eat ) , and an italian - style one which really do not serve nice food . they do the room service as well . I especially have one thing which be inedible : the garlic bread which just seem like a burn , hard and oily pizza base ... anyway , that be it for my bad experience , apart from not be able to get back into my room once but it be just because you have get to push the key card to the right while open your door . a colleague of mine though have a tv which do not work , and reception just tell he to go and watch tv in the lobby which really be not acceptable ... facility at the hotel also include bar , a pool table , a gym and an indoor swimming pool . the gym and pool be in the basement . the pool 's fairly small and shallow , so it be more for relax than swim . the gym 's get a few bicycle and running machine , nothing special but well than nothing if you like look after your shape . I guess it be why this hotel 's get these star , and also probably because of the impose entrance which make it look well than it really be . look back at my review , it really seem like an awful hotel after all , but really I do not feel like my stay be ruin and I do not expect the moon for a business hotel in this area . I would say it be below average , but far from be the bad hotel in the world ... 	
 oct 4 2007 	 think long and hard 	 we stay at the Britannia as it be very close to the O2 , where we go and see a gig . on arrive at the hotel we be tell that they do not have a booking under our name , and then they suddenly find it 5 min later . then some of our friend arrive and they be not so lucky ! ! they be tell the same - no room . they end up have to book in to a different hotel , even though they have a room confirmation email . the hotel be not interested at all . when we ask to speak to the manager no - one come out . we be tell to wait - 1hr later no one have come and we be then tell that the hotel be fully book and there be no room . we request a non - smoking room , what we get be a smoking room that have have the ashtray remove . it stank of smoke , to the point where we request for all the bedding to be change . the room and general decor look tired , and we be wake at 07.30am to have a room service even though we have a & quot;Do not disturb&quot ; sign hang on the door . the LDR ( London dockland railway ) be situate 1/2 a mile away and be trundle past every 20mins from around 06.30am . make quiet a noise . 	
 Sep 24 2007 	 do not waste your money 	 Britannia International Docklands LondonTerrible , terrible , terrible . I would not waste my money . just let I say I be there from late July to late Sept. it be for business in the area . now a person would think that any hotel would try to be accommodate to a long term guest . I be there with a big group and not the only one that have problem . I would say about 98 percent of the people have problem . they promise our group a lot but do not follow though . for example : new comfortable bed . we get bed but you might as well have be sleep on a concrete slab . refrigerator be also promise for our group yet never receive . it take about 3 hour to get check in . the room be out date with wall paper fall off the wall . the water pressure in some room be poor at good ( the water pressure have a hard time keep the shower valve up)i have to change my room once . I be lucky some have to change even more time before they have a room they could live with . the Staff be not very helpful . they sure do not seem like they want to be there . let alone enjoy their work . on one occasion , I leave my room to go out & amp ; place the ' please service room ' placard on the door handle . when I return a little later , the placard have be turn around to show the ' do not disturb ' side . apparently , rather than actually service the room , maid service just flip the sign around ! just gettte change at the front desk become an onerous task . regardless of how small the currency be offer , the front desk clerk ALWAYS have to go in the back . but only after waste time look in their cash drawer up front , seem to stall and look confused as to what they be do . how hard be it to change a 20 pound note into small bills?If you want a drink at the bar and there be a line of more than 5 , be prepare to wait at least 15 minute . in London you can not smoke in an enclosed space(that 's cool ) but if you step outside and smoke on there outdoor patio , the bartender will tell the manager and the manager(jason ) will call the police . the police come give the manager a dirty look and smile at we and leave . during the course of my visit , I be constantly harass when go out to smoke . it be ridiculous!everyday it be something else . if you have any say about stay at the Britannia International Docklands London ... don't . its not a friendly place . 	
 Sep 24 2007 	 bad Hotel on Earth 	 Food be terrible , service non - existant , front desk have very few people who could speak english and nobody seem to have any idea about reservation . it take 12 hour ( no joke ) to get my room sort and a key that would work . hotel staff be out right hostlie . I be in a group of 50 people and several people be sick from the breakfast . Room have no run hot water and staff seem unconcerned about this . I travel for a living all over the world and this be the bad I have ever experience . stay away ! 	
 Sep 23 2007 	 enjoyable stay ! 	 fabulous location , decent service and room luxuryb part be the lovely view from the window . enjoy the stay ! 	
 Sep 23 2007 	 Average 	 stay three night in September . room a bit musty ( can not open window ) with date decor but spacious enough with all you may require e.g. tea / coffee , iron , tv , AC , etc .. location good ( five minute to Jubilee line at Canary Wharf , or DLR to bank).wouldn't be my first choice the next time and would not like to have pay the rack rate . 	
 Sep 20 2007 	 poor quality and attitude 	 we have stay in this hotel to visit a play in the West end and to visit Billingsgate the next morning . the experience be not what I have expect . as note by other reviewer , the staff be not very friendly and the service be rather slow ; in particular when most of the staff be try to avoid customer in the queue . the room we get be alright , hower , it be difficult to book a wake - up call . the advertised number do not work , reception do not answer and the switch - board be grumpy . the first surprise be , that the hotel bar close for 15 minute and guest have to wait to get something to drink ; this be quite unique and I have never experience this before . the next one be that the hotel run out of nibble on a Friday evening ; the bar have nothing and send we to room service - the room - service do not have anything and complain about the bar send guest to they . finally , the hotel concierge do not know that the hotel have a pool - he have to ask a colleague whether there be one and how to find it . when I arrive back home , I send a letter ( on paper and by email ) to Britannia complain about the service in the hotel . foolishly , I expect a reply ; a justification , an apology or at least an acknowledgement . so far , I have hear nothing and I do not expect to do so in the future . this have be the final straw and I will avoid this group whenever possible . 	
 Sep 11 2007 	 great location 	 myself and my husband stay in the Britannina International Hotel London in September for one night . its location be a 5minute tube journey to the O2 Arena where we go to see Prince in concert . we fly into Heathrow hope on the tube to the hotel . the hotel be locate 5min walk from the Canary Warf tube station in the dockland . its a 4 star hotel , old style decore , staff very friendly . it have a bar , restaurant and niteclub we do not get a chance to try they out . bedroom be very clean , spacious with aircon , tv , tea / coffee , iron and room service . Mattress be a bit springie but sleepable . price be very good at £ 99 for a executive double with unsuite . Breakfast be not include and cost £ 13.50 per person . we think £ 27 be too expensive for breakfast , well option be a lovely deli accross the road from main entrance to hotel serve all day breakfast at £ 4.50 each . over all experience of hotel be good , great location for a nite out at the O2 Arena and very close to city by tube for site see 	
 Sep 8 2007 	 Bad Services and bad Hotel ever 	 I just return from a one week business trip to London and this be the bad possible hotel I have ever stay , for the price I pay . just to mention a few things:•staff be extremely rude , in person or over the phone•The phone in my room be not work and when I call for repair , I be tell that they could only do it the next morning - room service ? ? Emergency ? ? who care ... ?•dirty towel be fold nice and neat , as if I would not notice they be dirty with huge black stain when I open they up ... •the bed sheet be not clean , contain hair , and also have hole on the corner , as if they get rip out of barb wire ... •toiletrie be not replaced - bring your own to be on the safe side ... •good luck if you be expect a phone call from family or friend - no one answer the hotel 's main phone line and when someone answer after 10 or more ring , they transfer to the wrong room ... •the mattress on the room be so old and thin and the spring wear out , not comfortable at any level ... •breakfast at the hotel ? only if you want to get sick ! I have it on the first morning and never again .... good luck in find clean dish and silverware ... and do not expect to be greet or serve by anyone ; however , expect to be charge before you be get seated!•if you plan on use swimming pool , sauna , etc , be prepared to pay extra too ... •safety be another issue - you can enter and exit the hotel as you please , and cleaning staff leave room wide open while clean they , make it possible for anyone to enter your room at those times.•Room service knock at my door 3 time late at night , in different night , even though I have never order anything ... •don't even think about sleep in past 7:00 in the morning : there be a Docklands Light Railway run very close by and a building site construction right outside of your window . I be really disappointed with this hotel and definitively would not recommend it to anyone . 	
 Aug 29 2007 	 lovely facility 	 I go there for the great view , it be quiet , gym , and jacuzzi in the room , and the pool table . the staff be ok but if it they be not I would have like it anyway . I like the gym as you can be a member even if you do not stay there . there be a lot to do too , but we could not do everything . I would go there again . 	
 Aug 17 2007 	 bad stay 	 we be due to stay at this hotel for 5 night as part of we move house - pay for by my husband company . we arrive on Friday evening at 9 pm to check in . the lobby be pack and full of drunk . the check in process be lengthy and unfriendly . our room be a family room which have the appearance of old folk home . the window do not open at all due to the design of the hotel and the air conditioning do not go below 25 degree . this make I hyperventilate in bed ! breakfast next day be again unfriendly and full of workman and old people . the choice of food be appalling and the staff unfriendly . the whole place have a very grubby feel . we decide over breakfast that we would check out and go and sleep on the floor of our new house - yes it be that bad ! ! when I go to check out I be ask why I be check out . I be honest and tell the member of staff I hate the place . this be meet with no argument whatsoever . the car park be £ 15 from 6 pm to 9 am and the room we be in be £ 160 a night . a complete and utter rip off . thankfully my husband company pay the bill . 	
 Aug 15 2007 	 disgraceful ! 	 I have book a room for my wife and I for the Bocelli concert at the O2 , it be a spur of the moment thing book three day before arrival , I travel from abroad and my wife from Newcastle where we live . I arrive at the hotel at about 5 pm first where I want to check in and then meet my wife from the train and return to the hotel . I be refuse a room as I do not have the booking credit card on I , I explain that my wife have the card and would be at the hotel within the hour , the hotel would not let I check in . where be the rule that the card holder have to arrive before there partner ? we do not stay at the hotel . Eric Smith be the general manager , I find he to be arrogant and useless . a month later when the credit card statement come through they have take payment for the booking . fay in the account departmment refund the money , she be most helpful . I telephone the head office and ask to speak to the MD , I want he as boss of the company to be aware of what go on , I be put through to his p.a .. Gayle Sainthouse , who try to fob I off and refuse to give the name of the M.D. , why , be he not interested in customer service in a customer service industry?One thing be for certain , Gayle Sainthouse certainly be not ! she be also useless!I will never again attempt to book with Britannia hotel , absoloutely disgraceful . Keith Barrett , seghill , Northumberland . 	
 Aug 7 2007 	 Below average 	 have stay here a few time as I spend a bit of time in Canary Wharf with work . the hotel lobby give a reasonable impression , but do not be fool . I have stay about 5 different time as the company I work for have this at the top of their list ( £ 80 - £ 100 for a night roughly ) . the room be very dated . Chinz be the order of the day . flake gold tap , tile from the 80 's , pattern wall paper , and none of it particularly well maintain . my shower this more either freeze I to death , or cause my skin to blister . move the tap a millimeter and suffer ! room 934 for reference . I order room service . Sirloin steak , fry and a side salad , along with a half bottle of house red . this come to £ 30 and be without doubt the bad meal I have ever have . I could not actually tell whether it be a sirloin of beef , or pork . I leave the salad as it be mostly old lettuce , and the chip be awful . I pay £ 30 for this , so be warn . the bed 's be not comfortable in any of the room I have stay in . old mattress , and get this , they do not have duvet , but rather old fashioned blanket and an eiderdown ! again , think 70 's or 80 's and you be there!In short , this hotel have a good location , and be cheap , but apart from that , forget it . you have be warn ! 	
 Aug 6 2007 	 Beautifull - I love this hotel 	 this be the 2nd time I stay here and this time I be much happy with it . the room be beautiful , very comfortable atmosphere . it be all very clean and the room be service everyday to a good standard . the breakfast be much improve and be now actually quite good . it be an english breakfast that you could help yourself to , so you could have as much as you like . there be alot of choice , too , even a boil egg ! breakfast room be very nice and reasonably comfortable to be in . I very much enjoy my stay here and do not want to leave ! 	
 Jul 26 2007 	 worth it for the cheap deal .. 	 I have stay here before at some bargin rate - and it you be work in Canary Wharf it be well than the average Holiday Inn Express or Ibis hotel . it be get a little shaby however some of the room be tired - but some of the room have great view and the staff seem happy to move you to a well room if they can . I do not rate the food however and quite often the hotel be full of confused tour group / conference delegate . full rate be a complete rip off - but look for the special and it be worth it ! 	
 Jul 24 2007 	 Average 	 for 70 pound for a double room it be not bad . you could do well though . date room , uncomfortable bed , quite far from central London . plus points- excellent view of the Wharf , big room , a few minute to the near tube station . 	
 Jul 19 2007 	 a miss opportunity 	 I have stay at the Britannia twice now . the first room be a reasonable size but very dark and with a bathroom that need refurbishment . for my late stay I have a huge room with view over the water , Canary Wharf and the Millenium dome . the decor be fairly old - fashioned - I think the aim be for a victorian look . the room and public area be very clean . the bed be two single push together with a cheap uncomfortable mattress and although the bathroom be in a well condition but the sink plug would not stay closed and get the shower temperature right take a while . although include in my room cost , I do not bother with breakfast this time . the restaurant have fantastic view over the water but the food be unappeale and the jug use for tea / coffee do not seem to be keep separate , so you get tea that taste of coffee . there be a decent sized kettle in the room together with coffee sachet , teabag and biscuit . my overall feeling be that the hotel be miss a great opportunity - c , ean , good sized room in a great location very close to a dlr station and only 10 minute over the walkway to Canary Wharf with its shop and restaurant . all this let down by poor food , a poor mattress and dirty window spoil those great view . it look like another hotel be be build close by and I think the Britannia may lose custom . 	
 Jun 18 2007 	 Yep you do get what you pay for ... 	 book one night here through lastminute.com for an ' executive double ' ( which I know I do not get - be definitely a standard ) . fairly good first impression - rather old fashioned but warm and welcoming . staff completely unremarkable although efficient . my room be , well ... old fashion to say the least , but very clean . clean sheet and towel and generally tidy - no problem in that respect . the only thing I would say be the window on the outside be very grubby , obscure the view . however this can only be attribute to the massive building site right outside the window ... I have to admit , be there on a weekend there be not much noise from the building site at all , but it may be a different story throughout the week . it be not the quiet room in the world and it be very hot . the fan be too noisy to have on throughout the night and they do not seem to do an awful lot anyway ... spend much of the night fight with bedclothe and attempt to cool down!the shower be rather appalling - very much hot / cold / hot / cold ... pressure not bad . oh and the hairdryer do not work ... the main thing that irritate I about this place be someone burst into the room at 7:30am Sunday morning . admittedly I do not have the ' do not disturb ' sign on my door , but be not it customary to knock first anyway ? ? certainly not a great move on their part . anyway all in all , despite everything above , I actually have a fairly enjoyable time . there be nothing about the hotel that ' wow ' I or my boyfriend , nor particularly impressed , but it be clean , tidy , anonymous and in a great location . exactly what I be hope for . 	
 Jun 16 2007 	 you get what you pay for 	 Staff and service be good , and the hotel be very clean . the mattress must have be old than the hotel , though , as it have no padding over its spring . hot water be available --- if I take my shower before 8 am . after about 8 am , the hot water tap produce air and intermittent spit of hot water . my colleague have similar report on their mattress but most have hot water . 	
 Jun 3 2007 	 great hotel - huge room and very good service 	 we stay at this hotel during the bank holiday weekend and I can honestly say we have a wonderful time . my jaw almost hit the ground when I see how big the bedroom be and the bed be so comfortable even though it be two single push together . in addition , the view from the 6th floor be spectacular . my only major concern be that there be go to be a swanky appartment block build right next door so a ) there be go to be a lot of building noise soon and b ) it will probably block the view across the Thames to the Millennium Dome . because of this I be unlikely to stay there again unfortunately . I can not comment on the food because we be room only . the location of the hotel be excellent - only a few hundred metre from the near dlr station . 	
 Jun 2 2007 	 Good Hotel 	 very good for business traveler , if the internet will work in all hotel room . 	
 may 31 2007 	 terrible hotel at the price stay somewhere else ! ! 	 I travel to Canary Whary regularly for a couple of year and stay one night at the Britannia once but never again!I be on a rate of GBP 130 for an & quot;executive room&quot ; . on arrival I be inform that , despite book such a room , there be no executive style room leave . I be then give a room that can only be describe as awful . tiny , outdated and with a single bed with a scratchy woolen bed cover . the hotel be right beside the DLR line , so in addition to the awful room I have to put up with a great deal of noise from pass train . there be no reduction in my room rate when I check out which be extremely dissapointe give the box that I be put up in . Breakfast be a free for all . little staff coordination and instead of normal table , guest be expect to sit at galley style benchs which afford little privacy and be pretty uncomfortable if the hotel be busy . food be poor . the only good thing I have to say about the hotel be the location . it be to my knowledge the only mid price hotel in the Canary Wharf area as both the Marriott , Hilton and Four Seasons be top end . that say , if you have to stay locally , take the Hilton Docklands across the river which , although not good , be much well than this joint . well still stay at one of the hotel up river and take a clipper or the tube to Canary Wharf . 	
 May 28 2007 	 cheap not 	 we stay for one night , which cost around £ 70 . the set rate be far high ( and ludicrous - I do not expect anyone pay it).The hotel be rather old - fashioned , with extremely naff decor ( tonne of chinz , gaudy chandelier etc ) . do not go expect a styish stay , but it be ok for the price . the staff be , with one notable exception , sullen and uncooperative . check in and out be a pain . I have see bad , but I would expect well , even at a low price . the room be as ugly as the rest of the hotel , and fairly small . the double bed be clearly two single push together , with a big ridge down the middle . it be clean , though , as be the bathroom . the shower be a bit crummy , but it do work . breakfast be well aviode - it be a free - for - all buffet ( to get tea or coffee , for example , you have to help yourself to a thermo - jug from a counter ) . the table be not set properly . we do not use the basement pool , but we have a look - it be fairly small , but look ok.overall - if you need somewhere to stay at a lowish price , this hotel be ok - just make sure that you do not pay the standard rate , which be ridiculous . if you want a good hotel , there be a Hilton down the road . 	
 May 21 2007 	 it be ok ... nothing special ... but not bad 	 I be in this hotel for 10 day on business . I stay in three different room so I have a pretty good idea of what this hotel be all about . from what I be tell you do not get internet on the 2nd , 3rd , 4th & amp ; 5th floor which be an inconvenience . we need internet so we be move to the 8th floor . the room be standard to small in size , but they do have a nice view of canary wharf and the staff be very accommodate to our request . they even hook we up with some room service very very late at night even when the kitchen be close which be nice . I spend a couple of night in two room both with two small bed . I have to be honest I think this be the small bed I have ever sleep on in my entire life . if I roll over I would fall out.(in fact I do fall out of bed ... no joke ) . the bed I have on the 5th floor be not very comfortable , but the one on the 8th floor be very comfortable so , this be fairly hit or miss . the last few night I be in a suite on a upper floor . ok this room be very nice , big with a great bath room , a dining / desk area and a large very comfortable bed . I be pretty happy the whole time I be in this room .. and the bathroom be majorly upgrade with a jacuzzi tube ect . food : the buffet be very good and offer a wide variety of & quot;english&quot ; food . I enjoy the meal there a lot .... in fact I gain 5 pound in 10 day . LOL.It be very convenient to the Canary Wharf business district but be not really where you would want to be as a tourist . if I could make one suggestion to the owner of the hotel , I would tell they that they need to quit push two small bed together to make one big bed . just get a big mattress . it make a huge difference in comfort . overall I have no regret about stay there , and I would happily do it again . it be not a bad place at all but be certainly nothing special . I have not do a lot of travel though England so I do not have a lot to compare this property with , so take that into account when read my review . 	
 May 21 2007 	 fine if you can get a bargain rate 	 from the outside it look like a 70 's concrete block . on the inside it be all chintz and ornament which be a bit odd . after some confusion on check in ( we have book a twin room and be give a double ; then the next room we be give be already occupy ) we be upgrade and consequently get a big room than anticipate . Room be fine although the curtain do not exactly keep the daylight out and one bed squeak an awful lot . the bathroom be nice though with good shower / bath . we would get a last minute bargain rate though so be perfectly happy with value for money . great location if you need to be in Canary Wharf etc and very handy for anywhere on the DLR route include Greenwich . 	
 Apr 30 2007 	 Fine 	 like the previous few reviewer I find this hotel to be nowhere near as bad as some have describe . lounge area be comfortable , bedroom ( standard one ) be a little date ( and yes we also have problem with our ' key ' ) but clean and quite comfortable ; staff be generally very pleasant aswell . the Carvery in Jenny 's be pretty average , so one night we have a pizza from the pizzeria and that be fine . probably not worth pay the £ 75 a night but if you can get it cheap it be well worth it . 	
 Apr 22 2007 	 no problem at all 	 book this through AIRMILES & amp ; we have not have a bad deal from they yet but nearly cry when I read the review here . however I be ready for battle when we arrive at the hotelAt just after 9 pm , I time it & amp ; , it take 10 minute from be greet in the foyer to get to our room - I be not unhappy with that & amp ; it be about the same to check out at 10.30am . the room be a good size with extra pillow & amp ; blanket in the wardrobe . only complaint be that there be no luggage stand . I hate put case on the bed , you have no idea just what you have drag they through on the way ! Decor be good & amp ; the bedroom & amp ; bathroom be very clean . in the cold light of day the wallpaper & amp ; skirt board be a little scuffed ( shame on the former occupant who have not inform Housekeeping so that measure can be take to remedy fault ! ) but the bed linen & amp ; towel be pristine . the air conditioning work ok once we have figure it out . we have a dlr view room so it be a bit noisy but it do not bother we after the first night & amp ; it be great be so close to public transport . we have Continental Breakfast include with our booking , an upgrade to full English be £ 5.50 which we think be a bit much for what be available . nobody actually check what you be take though . on the first morning many of the table be uncleared when we arrive for breakfast but we ask if we could have a table clear next to the window & amp ; this be do straight away . Breakfast be not up to Hilton or Le Meridion standard but be ok to get you past lunch time . there be no sign for tea or coffee , it be help yourself ( coffee be in the blue thermo flask , tea in the white ) but if you ask the staff will bring you fresh . the breakfast buffet do seem a little understaffed but if you do not pay a lot for the room you can not expect the hotel to overstaff the restaurant . the Conservatory Bar be a great place to have a drink at the end of the day & amp ; the staff be very friendly . drink do not seem to be overly price either . the room keycard do seem a little ' eccentric ' but when we ask at reception a very nice lady come straight away to get we sort out . after that we just jiggle the card , twiddle the door handle & amp ; muddle through . think I read about the shower - well on the first morning I get the bath tap run , temperature ok etc , then switch it to shower , the shower head jump off the stand & amp ; soak I & amp ; quite a bit of the bathroom . second day I do the same - some of we never learn ! third morning I take a bath . we have no real problem here , nowhere in London be quiet . the staff be friendly & amp ; helpful & amp ; even though the hotel be undergo refurbishment & amp ; be full it be a really great place to stay . 	
 Mar 15 2007 	 love it ! 	 stay here for three night , do not understand all the terrible review the hotel be very nice . we book an excecutive room and it be comfortable and very clean do a finger test for dust ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! sheet be nice and crisp . bathroom very nice and very clean shower powerful and hot not like people say in other review . only two negative , if you decide to have a cup of tea or coffee downstair beware very expensive ! and if your thinking of an upgrade on your room think again . we have an excecutive room and the people we be with pay £ 100 more for their room and it be not as nice it be tired and floral ! good location would stay here again . excellent break and by the way go and see we will rock you absolutely brilliant . 	
 Mar 8 2007 	 cold shower 	 we could not get in to any hotel in the immediate vicinity of Canary Wharf , so this place be offer as the next good thing . one of the most important factor about a hotel for I be the shower , I be happy to put up with weak shower as long as I do not have to spend age try in vain to tweak the temperature ! however , the shower at the Britannia be attrocious ! not only be they weak ( despite the tremendous pressure from the bath tap ) , but if you mix some cold water into the mixer you will find that the cold water push the hot water back down to the boiler and you have to completely turn the shower off and turn the bath tap on to restore it ! the net effect be , you can only use the hot water no matter how hot or cold it happen to be . we tell the concierge and he say & quot;we get a few problem with the shower , it be normal&quot;.move onto the bar , it be a fairly low - rent affair , the kind of place you would expect in a less salubrious part of a city . I feel quite out of place in my suit :-) interestingly , the bar be surround by heavy duty cage - work , not sure why!i do not try the food as I be not fill with much confidence in their ability , besides , the tube be nearby and you can eat easy enough nearby . I will not be stay agin , next time if there be no availablity in the Wharf , I will simply stay near to the City and use the tube in the morning . 	
 Mar 8 2007 	 Horrific ! ! ! ! ! 	 we arrive to be greet by hotel receptionist with the big attitude problem I ve come across- service with a smile I think not ! ! there be a problem with the room an honest mix up that could easily of be resolve , however it appear to be too much trouble , on finally be allocate a room we find it dirty , with a musty smell and to be perfectly honest if it be not for sheer exhaustion and desparation I would not of stay there ! we be give no assistance with our bag and put on the top floor of the hotel in the smoker area despite the fact I be heavily pregnant ! ! ! we be keep awake by pass plane all night not the hotel fault understandably but they do not exactly warn you ! the hotel bar be in a nice setting overlook the wharf shame about the staff ! we venture into london for a LOVELY meal and on our return to be greet with the same poor attitude from hotel staff we decide to leave the next day . we be make to feel uncomfortable and check out at our first opportunity the next morning , which be not much less smooth that our arrival . this shabby hotel ( yes the picture look nice its a different experiance once you venture in ! ! ! ) and the attitute of its staff ruin our break . 	
 Mar 1 2007 	 great at a bargain price look for alternative if it be full price 	 be to stay at this hotel twice , in 2004 and 2005 at Christmas . at the time , they be run an offer to make the room £ 21 per person , per night - include taxis - which for London be outrageously cheap . on my second visit I notice the base rate - upwards of £ 100 per night . if I have pay this , I would of be disgust . the hotel be quite a treck from all the attraction , but find the Tube be easy enough . you be probably look at about 30 minute journeytime include the walk to either the DLR or Canary Wharf Tube stop . as for the htoel itself - room be pretty basic , but clean . tea make facility in room . the heat bother I - as another reviewer have say , it will not go any low than 22.5 , and the window do not open , which would really irk I have I pay a lot for the room , as it be cheap however I can overlook such thingsI be currently look to stay in London again , and they do not offer the bargain rate , which put I off and compell I to find something close to the attraction . 	
 Feb 26 2007 	 enjoy the Britannia - Loved the location 	 book a double room through [ ---- ] at a bargain £ 55 PRPN , include breakfast , and overall be well satisfied with our stay . read some poor review and be a bit concerned . however , find most aspect well satisfactory . reception and a downstairs bar / set area that look right out onto the dock give the impression of a 4 star facility . our room ( enter by key card ) on the 5th floor have victorian decor in keep with the rest of the hotel , generally in good condition although some bit approach re - furbishing time ( carpet a bit worn etc).Did complain that air - con be too hot , maintenance man suddenly appear and open the locked window , seem to do the trick . Breakfast be a just adequate buffet , although we be tell we only qualified for cold continental , which we ignore . finally the good aspect of the Hotel be the location , right on the South Quay dock , a nearby footbridge take you into Canary Wharf , skyscraper , bar , underground shop , with tube and dlr ready to take you into old London town . 	
 Feb 23 2007 	 simply a rubbish hotel 	 this review be from someone that stay there more than 20 time . the only reason I do so be its convenient location to Canary Wharf ( this be where my office be at the time ) . that be say , I often decide to stay much far away from the office just to avoid it . the hotel itself , if renovate , could be ok . unfortunately , it be old and tired . 30 % of the time ( at least ) , there be something not work in the room . if you get a room face the DLR , it be really noisy for forget easy sleep . if that be all ... the problem be really the personnel . sorry to say that but they should first replace the management that be entirely fail at their duty . I have many problem with my stay ( typically something not work in my room ) . the bad part be that it often take hour ( or day ) to talk to a manager . when I be able to , he be just about as capable as the fake plant in the hotel ... I strongly suggest that unless you be pick this hotel for his proximity to whatever your goal be , you simply avoid the place . an hotel like can not please anybody , not even with the low possible standard . 	
 Feb 13 2007 	 what a catastrophe . . . 	 the Hotel Britannia International be a sad and sorry hotel whose lone attraction be the fact that it be centrally locate in Canary Wharf and close to the Tube station . the facility be out of date , the structure tired and old . wear carpet , mouldy tile , andshabby , back - break bed be but a few of the amenity that await . the glum staff meander listlessly through their assign task , look almost as unhappy as the guest they be compel to serve . in fairness , this attitude perhaps stem from the fact that the staff member themselves be compel to work in the same , second - rate environment be flog to the customer at exhorbitant price . the substandard workplace make even routine item such as check out or change a 50 Euro note an utter nightmarefor all involve . if you be travel on business and need a bed in a central location in Canary Wharf , then the Britannia International be a tolerablealternative though hardly a desirable one . if you be not so constricted , then look elsewhere and save yourself the money and grief . 	
 Feb 12 2007 	 above expectation 	 the hotel be situate very near the canary warf tube . the place look wonderful . its very clean , all room have amazing Thames view ( even the back side one ) . the restroom be very clean and modern , and the bed be fine . one small problem might be the heat but it be ok.i be scared of all these review here but when I be there I find out that the hotel be great and worth the money.the breakfast be also wonderful.dont hesitate and book it if you want a 4 star london hotel but can not afford Hilton ! 	
 Feb 5 2007 	 tired hot and shabby . 	 my partner stay here for 4 night during the Toy Fair , I be lucky and only have to stay one night . Air con do not work so the room be at a constant 22.5 degree . the bed be hard and lumpy and the sheet threadbare . the lighting be dull and grey . the service be dreadful , they look half a sleep and you feel as though you be put they out . Breakfast be not a good experience , no tea or coffee be offer , go find it yourself . the only redeeming feature be the location . there be other hotel . do not go here . dreadful . 	
 Jan 14 2007 	 Dobule book 	 Booked the Britannia International with Alpharooms.com 3 month in advance and pay up front . received our voucher by e - mail and have no more correspondence . we arrive on the due date on the due time , only to be tell that there be no room at the inn!apparently , at the time of the booking ( in September ) their system be down and a double booking occur ! 3 month in advance remember and no further correspondence . they send we to their other hotel , & quot;of the same standard ( 4*)&quot ; , but no pool , & quot;but they would make it nice for us&quot ; . this hotel be the Britannia Hampstead . it be not 4 * , I would have be push to give it 3 * . we receive a bottle of wine to & quot;make it nice&quot ; , which be not very nice at all!the room be a smoking room - not request by we ! the smell in the corridor be bad , but even worse in the room ! there be stain on the carpet , and on the wardrobe door , the lamp be not work , there be old , old furniture , fray bedspread - no duvet , campbe for the child that sag in the middle , no view of the Thames as we book ! the view be condensation on the window , complete with mildew . we be not the only people to be move , speak to other people at breakfast , show that they too have be move after arrive at 9.00am and tell that their room be not ready and to go shop for the day , it would be ready when they get back ! they arrive back in the evening to discover that there be no room , that they have double booked!!!When we arrive at the International , it be very , very busy with people wear badge , there be clearly a conference take place a the hotel , and we believe that they take our booking . the International clearly think that it be okay to lose our booking for the conference - probably for a lot more money!we will never book with Britannia again or Alpharooms . we think that we would take it up with alpharoom when we get home as we book with they and pay they in advance . however , they do not accept responsibility . you have to take it up with the hotel at the time!totally spoil our weekend . 	
 Dec 15 2006 	 Mediocre but at least it have A / C 	 I stay here because I have client meeting in Canary Wharf over 2 day , so I think it would be convenient . it be , but the stay be pretty mediocre , so I be not sure it be worth it . the hotel be be swarm with guest when I arrive , so I wait 30 minute in line to get check in . my room be very large , but it have old carpet , worn sheet / comforter , and the furniture be a good 30 year old . on the positive side , I get a good rate ( I think due to the location ) , and the pizza restaurant make a good pizza for dinner . otherwise it be kind of a disappointment . also , I stay in August when it be very hot , and I be very thankful for the A / C. so I guess that count for something ... 	
 Dec 11 2006 	 a poor experience 	 stay commence 20th October 200625minute to get check in , electronic guest room door key do not function , therefore I have to return to reception for a further 20 minute wait , leave my family wait in the corridor . many of the staff have a surly attitude , some wait staff appear to be lack in their personal hygiene , ' not a very pleasant experience when one eat in the hotel restaurant' . some bedroom and bathroom fitting be break , a poorly maintain shower head result in a flood bathroom floor . we only become aware that the swimming pool be out of order when we go to use it and be confront with a handwritten note hang over the stair , explain that it be out of use and would be for some time . I have advise my friend and family not to consider this hotel , it be advertise at the time as a four star hotel , I have stay in far well three star hotel . 	
 Nov 27 2006 	 complete disaster 	 do not bother book . hotel overbook routinely mean your pre - pay room count for nothing . service be appalling . fail to offer satisfactory alternative accommodation . disgrutled customer fight in the bar . in my opinion , avoid at all cost . you have be advise ...... 	
 Nov 14 2006 	 this place need to get with the time . 	 stay here in conjunction with a seminar that my place of work be organise in the city . not many free room in London at the time , hence I have to stay here . this hotel seem to be very unsure of its own identity as its very modern on the outside and very chintzy on the inside . room be at good average . my room , a double with a jacuzzi , turn out to be two twin bed put together . but get into it be the problem as it take I three attempt to get into my room as the room key do not work . when I speak to staff about the problem , all I get from the duty manager be & quot;I can not help you speak to my colleague over there.&quot ; the overall experience with this hotel seem to sum up what be wrong with the Britannia chain . they just seem to plod along while all other hotel in the area seem to evolve with the time . refurbishment should be an option for this place , if only for the benefit of the customer . there be a brand new Hilton just along the road from this place , I will probably be use that in the future ( and I be sure I will not be wake up by the constant rumbling of the DLR train ) . 	
 Nov 1 2006 	 not sure what the fuss be about 	 I stay for 4 night , and before going read the report on Tripadvisor , I be therefore expect a horror stay . check in be smooth , room spacious , breakfast be good , plenty of choice , and the room be clean every day with a change of towel if we want they . only slight downside be that the twin bed be a little small and slightly uncomfortable . yes the pool be shut , but all hotel have to do maintenance at some time . be easy to get to from either Canary Wharf Tube or South Quay DLR ( which be the near station ) . 	
 Oct 30 2006 	 only if you be stick 	 room : it be suppose to be ready at 2 pm but because I request a non smoking room this be not the case . the room itself be date and because of this give the impression that it be not very clean . my double room consist of two single bed push together . Keycard do not work properly which involve numerous visit to reception . all reception staff appear to be trainee . Breakfast be poor , all the fruit be can fruit and the & quot;English breakfast & quot ; look terrible . I stay here for business purpose and it be just a short distance from London City airport and a 5 minute walk to Canary Wharf . this be the only good thing about this hotel . 	
 Oct 23 2006 	 pool not even open ! ! ! 	 I book and then see people 's review . so I contact the hotel to make sure my booking have be recieve . a day later it be confirm . when I send the email to confirm , I also ask if the pool be open ( one review say it be not ) and be tell it probably would not be - I think this be awful , when you book you should be tell this , I be not 	
 Oct 23 2006 	 Book elsewhere . anywhere 	 I stay here for a business trip as I foolishly believe the ad on lastminute.com . after fly from Australia , I be look forward to a bit of comfort in London . this place be something else , it take they about 30 min to check I in , whcih largely consist of a gormless look young girl , constantly press the same key on the keyboard . my room have a remarkably kitsch naval feel to it and I do not think it have be clean since Francis Drake 's time . the room do have a jacuzzi alas . I try it , after 5 min all the water have run out of it . I look back now and it be quite amusing , at the time it be not though especially as you pay good money for the privilege . the hotel have a feeling of neglect and lack of customer care . believe I the review be not misleading . do yourself a favour and book somewhere else . I be due to stay for a fortnight , I check out after 4 arduos day and book into a very nice hotel a couple of minute away . 	
 Oct 8 2006 	 Book elsewhere 	 without doubt , the bad hotel I have ever have the misfortune to stay in . room be an absolute disgrace , wallpaper be peel , furniture be shabby and the double room consist of two ( very uncomfortable ) single bed place together . this hotel require a serious make over , and should not be allow to advertise in the current manner 	
 Oct 4 2006 	 tired and shabby 	 we stay at the Britannia for 4 night late September 06 , take advantage of a special offer on the room rate . from the word go it be not a happy experience . a late arrival at after 1 am find a queue at check in because ' a new booking system be be implement ' accord to the sign on the desk and the receptionist clearly do not know how to use it properly ( maybe adequate staff training be need ? ) there be only one member of staff on the desk although several other could be see to be lurk in the room behind reception . it take over 45 m to get the room . however we do get a free upgrade to an ' executive ' room . the hotel in general be very tatty and in urgent need of complete refurbishment – lot of peel wallpaper , hole in wall , chip floor tile , wear carpet , chip faded paint etc . the room be big but very tatty like the rest of the hotel , the door key ( swipe card ) do not work properly , the security lock be break , there be a loose floor tile in the bathroom , all the bath fit plating have be polish away , and it overlook the light railway that run near the hotel ( 5 am train noise – great ! ) a room change to the front side of the hotel solve the noise problem but not the tatty décor or faulty door swipe card which fail to work properly for the duration of our stay . what be bill as " continental breakfast " be include but this be so poor as to be an insult , serve in a breakfast room with all the ambience of a prison waiting room and only one waiter , so table and counter be dirty . we only take one breakfast and for those unfortunate who get book into this hotel there be a nice deli over the road and down the step opposite the front of the hotel ( not open weekend but lot of food place in nearby Canary Wharf ) . in summary – I suggest you do not stay here . on the plus side , there be plenty of free newspaper provide . 	
 Oct 3 2006 	 not the good place to stay 	 London be fully book last week so I end up out in dockland . the hotel be 5 minute walk from canary wharf station , reception be not the good as he be a trainee and confuse when I his explain I have actually book a none smoking room . thankfully the supervisor take control and I be upgrade to a penthouse room , this be a little date but the view where fantastic . Breakfast be awful , I feel I be in a work canteen and want to escape , on top of that the food be cold and not appetize at all . I stay for two day and visit the bar on both day , like the breakfast room its not very inviting and the stock level be poor / none existent . do not ask for slim line tonic ... on the whole I do not want to go back , its not really a pleasant stay ... 	
 Sep 30 2006 	 Staff not friendly 	 I read the review before I go so I be prepared and it go about what all the review say . the front desk staff desparately need a customer service class . the checking in process take forever and they disappear behind this door constantly and you stand there not sure what they be do , why they be do it or if they be ever come back . not the great feeling . when you check in , make sure you tell they to leave your card open for phone call , breakfast etc . no idea why they charge the hotel and nothing else , then you can not make a phone call and have to go all the way downstairs , wait in the line again and straighten it out . the breakfast be very expensive , if you can get it elsewhere , do it . the coffee be pretty bad . the big thing be that the consierge never answer the phone and the maid take a big pile of my belonging cause she think I check out of the room and leave it there . my luggage be lose and would not come in till the next day . that take 6 full day to straighten out . the pool be under repair during my stay which be a bummer . the only bright spot be the bar . very friendly staff , could have be a well selection of beer though . I'm stay at the Mariott Canary Wharf next time . 	
 Sep 16 2006 	 keep away 	 arrive with reservation but tell I that they have no record of it and be bluntly tell to go away as they could not help I . thankfully I be able to find an alternative hotel quite quickly ( the internet be great when you really need it but shudder to think what would happen if it be late at night ) the next day contact the people who do the reservation and be give a copy of the confirmation from this hotel . after a few day get a short e - mail apology from the Brittania and a promise of a free upgrade next time . you have be warn 	
 Sep 11 2006 	 a hotel with Character which be misunderstood 	 I stay at the hotel from august to september on and off have to work hard all day like all business man we look forward to get back to the hotel and hit the bar to get back to normality . I have stay in many hotel where the bar have always have a quite and solom feel but not here the bar be lively have it be group of guest enjoy themselves to the friendly bar staff talk to I about sport or their travel this be a nice personal touch which some hotel lack.i remember I be check in and I have a bad flight delay the usual with add security measure and all I get to the hotel wary of it be rep but to my surprise the taxi door open to see who I see on his badge head concierge this be refreshing to see a manager lead by example he bring my bag to the reception desk and introduce I to the receptionist and the young lady check I in with a smile which after my flight be well needed.went to my room to find that even though the room do not a modern decor it be functional and comfortable . having unpacked and think I would see a bit of london I go down to the lobby via one of their three lift be I meet a well suited gentleman who ask how I be I ignore he as I think he as just another guest but it turn out that this chap be a manager he assist I with my information that I require as the concierge be busy.without drag on my stay be refreshing to say the least . the staff be friendly expecially the front office team and the bar staff . I can not comment about breakfast as I be always out by 6am.i would suggest that wth any hotel I would take everything with a pinch of salt everyone taste be different I would stay here again give the chance . 	
 Aug 18 2006 	 2nd time unlicky 	 I stay at this hotel in June 2006 - when I arrive at 2 am , after a long , delay flight I be tell that there be no room available and so be move to another hotel . I finally get to the 2nd hotel ( far from Canary Wharf ) at 3.30am . I return for the second night of my stay and have be upgrade to a suite , which be a pleasant surprise . because of this , I decide to give the hotel a second last month . this time be even bad - I be give a room which , although ' non - smoke ' smell strongly of smoke . the bed be incredibly uncomfortable and the food be horrible ( they cover a plate of boiling soup with clingfilm which melt into the soup ..... ) . when I call to ask if I could be move to a well room , which do not smell , they tell I the good they could do be to open the window - then fail to return to close it when I ask so I have to sleep with the window open while it be 11 degree outside overnight . just do not ruin your holiday by stay here ! 	
 Aug 17 2006 	 good value in London a good hotel 	 I book this hotel a while back ( I get a very good deal through the Britannia hotel website ) , but after read the review on this site I be rather worried about my stay as there seem to have be lot of negative comment leave about this hotel . I have just return from a 3 day stay at the Britannia International and I honestly could not find any fault with the hotel or it be staff . the hotel claim to be 4 star , in truth it be probably more like 3 star but if you can get a cheap deal through the website then this hotel offer fantastic value for money . our room be on the 12th floor ( top ) so have lovely view on Canary Wharf tower . the room be very large ( when compare to most central London hotel ) , have a large bathroom and comfortable bed . the decor of the room be fine , while it may not be cut edge design the room be practical and perfectly clean , as be the rest of the hotel I might add . the only meal take at the hotel be breakfast , these too be fine and there be lot of choice on offer . all the staff I speak to be helpful , friendly and efficient . in my opinion the hotel be in a great location as it be far enough away from central London to get away from the crowd but yet it be within easy reach . both Canary Wharf tube station ( Jubilee line ) and South Quay dlr station and within a few minute walk so you can be in central London in about 20 minute . the Canary Wharf area also have lot to offer as there be a large underground shopping mall and a good selection of bar & amp ; restaurant nearby . to be honest I do not think this hotel deserve such a low rating , I can only assume that some traveller have have bad experience . I think this hotel be excellent value for money and would recommend it to anyone look for a good value London hotel 	
 Aug 17 2006 	 bad hotel 	 there be a catalogue of problem when deal with this hotel and I can not say strongly enough that no - one should ever enter this hotel let alone pay money to stay in it . I get marry on 5 August 2006 and have this hotel book for my husband and I on our first night . I have negotiate a discount rate for my relative that be fly over for the wedding so I be hopeful that the room and service would be top notch . prior to the wedding I have to spend several hour correct the major mistake that reservation have make with regard to booking make by family . the reservation department get every boo wrong , one example be they book my mother in for 3 night in 3 room . bear in mind my mother live in London and be only book one night , one room!on the wedding day my brother be unable to check we in , despite be tell he could by my contact there in ( Travel Trade Manager ) . the & quot;lady&quot ; in reservation tell I that I have to leave my wedding reception ( in Corney & amp ; Barrow - Cabot Square ) , walk over in my dress , check myself in , and then walk back to my wedding reception ! my brother want to arrange for flower and champagne to be put in our room but that be not to be . I be then tell by the & quot;lady&quot ; in reservation that there be no booking for my mother - that the booking they have for she be for night of 3 August ! they do not have a booking for my mother at all and they be fully book . I be deal this phone call mid - way through my wedding reception and understandably be get very upset . the & quot;lady&quot ; on reception then tell I that if I & quot;continue to talk to she in that way she would hang up!&quot;to make matter bad , when we get to the hotel after my wedding reception we be meet by another bride and groom , the bride be in tear . they have book their room back in March only to find that they have a twin room on their wedding night ! I believe they get a well deal in the end though as they be transfer to the Marriott . the bar be not open when I be tell it would be and no effort to find alternative accommodation for my mother be make so on our wedding night , my mother have to spend the night in my room - a very romantic first night would not you say?!when we get to the room it be shabby , with big chunk of wood have be take from furniture ( it look like a dog have bite it off ! ) , the staff be rude and could speak very little English , the food at breakfast be under cook , cleaner leave their glove on our clothe , the list go on . on the Monday it take I go through my personal email to prove that have make an almighty muck up and even then we do not really get a satisfactory outcome . manage to get the money charge for my mother 's room refund and we get our room for 2 night for free but that be it . no compensation for our ruin wedding night , no sorry , not even a token bottle of champagne - NOTHING!I implore you to never , ever stay in this shoddy , shabby hotel - it be the bad hotel I have ever stay in and most definitely the bad customer service I have ever receive . I be inmidst of make further complaint but funnily enough - I be still wait for a reply ! 	
 Aug 11 2006 	 Nice hotel near Excel 	 the hotel be very close to excel which be ideal for our trade show . its a big hotel with great facility which be need as you be out of the city . the location be fine and be close to the Docklands Railway transport . the restaurant be very nice in the hotel and I would like to thank the staff for a pleasant stay and help I with my late night taxi ! cheer . 	
 Aug 7 2006 	 absolutely terrible 	 book a room for one night , and ask for a double bed . what I get be a free upgrade ( ? ! ) that turn out to be two single bed push together ! not only that , but the upgrade be not worth anything , except that there be lot of floor space . BEDS be very poor , hard , could feel the spring and be very squeaky . there be no duvet , only horrible old itchy 10 year old blanket with clean sheet ( a plus point ) . Bathroom be adequate , barely . it have a poor shower . ask for a bottle of wine at the bar and they only have one white , a pinot grigio . have to go to the restaurant to get a bottle of something different and then have to pay extra to get it deliver to my room , very much later . we could not bear to even try the breakfast , so I go for a walk and get it myself . I see the queue full of tourist , very early and so we would have to wait for 40 min at 0730 on a Sat morning ! not acceptable . all in all , a terrible night stay and they will not have my business again . if I be you , I would look at the Marriot or the Hilton nearby and pay the extra . 	
 Jul 28 2006 	 should 've write this early 	 I see some bad thing about this hotel , but in 2004 the stay be nice . the price we get be excellent for London . you feel like you be in a 4 star hotel . it be on the water , so the view be very nice . the room be clean and spacious . the breakfast be good . do not eat dinner there . it be very close to the rail system to get to the attraction . I be guess that the bad review be from people that be never happy . at the Underground station by the hotel , there be an underground mall . very nice . 	
 Jul 19 2006 	 do not stay here ... 	 without doubt this hotel have the bad service I have ever experience . on arrival at 4.05 pm myself and 2 colleague be inform that our room have be cancel and resold because we have not arrive by 4 pm . nowhere on our documentation do it state this be a requirement . the receptionist be gormless in the extreme before finally call a duty manager who make Basil Fawlty seem like a reasonable person . she explain that it be not the hotel 's responsability and that they would try to find alternative accomadation for we but basically it be tough . eventaully 2 and a half hour after we arrive , we manage to secure a twin and a triple room so we all share . this be something we have to work hard to achieve as the duty manager insist there be no other room available as the ' twin room all get let out to tour group ' she do not check she just talk over we and say that this be standard hotel practice - having just travel around the World I can confirm it be not ' normal ' for a hotel to cancel a booking if the customer have not arrive by 4 pm , especially without give the customer any warning that you might do that . the room be hot ( aircon be ineffective ) , dirty and small . the bad service continue from the concierge send we in a completely the wrong direction to a ' nearby restaurant ' to room service turn up with a breakfast order at 6.45am as request only to demand cash for the breakfast . the roomservice then argue with we that we could not put the bill oto our room ( even though they have our credit card number ) and proceed to barge into the room pick up the telephone and talk to reception before hand the phone to we and say we would need to speak to they . I have honestly never stay anywhere with such terrible service and would implore anyone think this might be a good place to stay to think again . it be a terrible place in need of renovation and without the slight understanding of customer service . do not stay here . 	
 Jul 16 2006 	 awful stay 	 I stay at the Britannia International for one week in June as I be work in Canary Wharf and no other hotel be available in the area . it be a terrible stay . the mattress in the bed be incredibly uncomfortable - I think I could feel every spring in it . and overall the room decor be incredibly ugly ( there must have be at least 6 clash pattern ) . far there be no clock in the room and the wake - up call service do not work for two day while I be there . the staff be not very helpful when I explain that this be a problem . the hotel itself be generally shabby and uncomfortable . both the food and service be well below what you would expect from a supposedly 4 star hotel . the gym be small , with old equipment , and be not include in the price of your room . during an evacuation because of a fire in the hotel ( yes a real fire ! ) I have the opportunity to speak with other guest who complain about the air conditioning not work in their room ( there be a heat wave in London ) amongst other problem . not recommend . I have since then stay in a hotel in Central London when I be unable to find accomodation at the well hotel in Canary Wharf . 	
 Jun 22 2006 	 bad ever 	 I stay in this hotel think it be a four star accomodation but its hardly 2 star in term of the the quality of room , service and discurtious staff . if you really want to pay for punishment then this be the place for you ! otherwise if you be really stuck , sleep in your car or hire a tent but do not go there ! there be nothing bad about this place but worst ! ! ! 	
 Jun 19 2006 	 very disappointing 	 my wife and I be due to stay at this hotel for three night and check out after one . the reception staff speak very limited english and do not seem to be able to handle the vast amount of tour group that stay here . the room be spacious and with fantastic vie of Canary Wharf . this be mar by the delapidated state of the furnishing include a mattress that be so old the spring be poke up into my back . we try to make an outside phone call and could not . the front desk inform we that we need to set up an account . after complain and convince tham that we have give our credit card detail at check in thay give we an outside line . we park our car in the underground parking garage and be tell it be 15 pound for 24 hour . after two hour I have to take my car out to go shop . the front desk tell I that I have to pay the parking for the two hour at 2 pond per hour before we could take the car out . this make no sense , if I have to go out a few time during the 24 hour it could end up cost I 48 pound total . I complain to the manager directly and after 15 minute of heated conversation at the front desk he give I a ticket say I would only be charge the ! 5 pound total . he even try to make out to I that he be do I a favour . I think it sad the way a hotel like this can promote the fact it be a 4 star when it be a 2 star at well . this hotel fall far below our expectation . we will not return to this hotel . 	
 Jun 8 2006 	 horrible 	 I stay here in June for a conference and therefore have no choice but to take up the offer of accomodation . however , I can only describe this hotel as a ' hell hole ' which be in serious need of an update . this hotel might have be state of the art in the early 90 's but be now past its sell by date!!The room be shabby , outdated and very musty . the net curtain ( yes net curtain ! ! ) have hole in they , the carpet be threadbare in place and the decor be very ' chintzy ' . I be awake very early by the constant sound of the dlr as it rattle past the window as well as man shout and swear at the top of his voice at 6 am in the morning ( be warn the wall be very thin!!)Breakfast be also a dissapointment and despite the sign indicate that guest have to wait to be seat , several staff completely ignore I when I wait at the reception desk and one even stand next to I swear loudly because he could not unlock a store cupbard . in the end I walk to my own table and be not even offer the option of tea / coffee ! ! whilst there be a choice of continental of full english both be below average . like the room , lunch and evening meal be also very dubious and some of the dish taste like they have be re - heat several time . as a result I come home with a rather upset stomach!On the plus side ( and there be only one plus ! ) the room be rather large and spacious but this do not really compensate for the rest of the hotel . in term of location , I would not choose to stay in Canary Wharf again unless I be on business and I would certainly never go back to the Britannia . the area be busy on weekday and there be plenty of bar which be nice to sit outside in the summer but be desert at weekend and be therefore not recommend for tourist . 	
 May 28 2006 	 great value for the internet price 	 go on the internet to get the direction for this hotel and accidently come upon Trip Advisor . read the review which be mostly appalling about this hotel and be somewhat apprehensive about my stay there . by this time it be too late to cancel my internet booking and I be expect the bad . what a pleasant surprise I have , the staff be extremely friendly and very helpful , the room be clean and the breakfast ( the only food we consume ) be absolutely fine . the only thing I do agree with be that the hotel could do with an uplift as it be slightly date . I do not have any qualm about stay there again ! 	
 May 25 2006 	 Rude Staff Stale Rooms Poor Food - what more could you ask for 	 I be look for a cheap alternative for business travel in canary wharf . this place be not the solution . after 6 week of stay here 3 night a week I could not take any more . absolutely consistent- rude staff- no iron in room ( for business travel!)- terrible food- non smoking room that smell like astray- bed cover must never have be washed- v slow check in / check out- painful decor- no points program for frequent guest ( the main reason I be not go back!)To be fair - a couple of plus points- free wireless internet access ( a first for UK hotels?)- good location for the wharf ( 10 min to main block)- it do have a small fitness room with pool . ( but you pay extra ) 	
 May 23 2006 	 kitch and rude 	 the decorator of this hotel should be fire , and so the personel manager . my room cause the most severe degree of visual indigestion ever encounter . the hugely mismatch floral fabric , torn , discoloured lace curtain , red and blue patterened carpet , long over - use quilted beadspread , gold and red armchair ... good to keep your sunglass on . Staff act through - out as if they be trap in a policy they do not support . upon check - inn there be no mention that all extra be to be settle in cash . with no minibar in the room , I order a bottle of water from room - service . this arrive half an hour later and have to be settle in cash . serve myself from the very mediocre breakfast buffet , when leave the restaurant , I be ask what I have and then tell to settle in cash . my reservation be make one month in advance with a Gold Card ... upon arrival at midnight after a long flight , the front office manager could not retrieve the booking depite I hold a copy of the email confirm my reservation ... overall , who give this hotel four star ? 	
 May 18 2006 	 there be get to be alternative ... 	 I would like to echo some of the thought of other reviewer - this be not a hotel of a 4 star standard . the hotel be very tired and date , as be the & quot;red carpet&quot ; outside the hotel , it feel more like the staff entrance rather than a guest main entrance ! the service be slow check I in and out , and they try to charge I the full rate even though I book a cheap rate over the internet of Euro 75.the room be tidy but furnishing be tired . the bathroom be a reasonable size but do not expect any quality bathroom product . I do not use any hotel facility so can not comment . on the upside , the hotel be well locate in Canary Wharf which be the main reason why I choose to stay here and the price . the hotel be also close to the Canary Wharf underground station . that say , if you do not need to stay in Canary Wharf , you can definitely find well value for money option elsewhere in town , there be just not & quot;feel good&quot ; factor . 	
 May 13 2006 	 not even a 1 Star 	 this hotel be rate at 4 star and it be not at all . room be horrible , very old fashion , very basic and very cold!!staff be rude and Manager advise I to wirte to the Head Office for a resolution .. write to the Head office , but the Manager who respond just regurgetate my letter in his reply and just say sorry , no resolution offer , be not happy at all . do not stay AT this hotel ! ! very poor quality and over price . Travelodge at Liverpool street far well than this one and that be a 3 star and much cheap ! ! 	
 May 2 2006 	 not even worth 1 star 	 we choose this hotel as part of a business dinner , base on its star rating and location to central London . how shocked we be . the hotel be about a 10 - minute walk to Canary Wharf and the many bar and shop there , as well as a 5 minute walk to South Quay Docklands Light Railway Station , with its link to the City and the rest of the Docklands area . even though it be a 4 - star hotel , the decor of the bulding be incredibly date . it be maybe a 4 - star 20 year ago , but our room be dirty , with furnishing that should have be throw out year ago . on arrival the staff , though efficient , be not very polite . we head down to use the pool and that be an experience . the pool area be dirty , the change area look as though they have not be clean in week and there be no help how to get a key to use a locker . we have to just leave our valuable by the side of the pool . the floor of the sauna be also litter with rubbish . Disgusting . the rest of the hotel could well be describe as okay . the room on the first floor where we have the dinner have good view of Docklands and the service staff be pleasant enough . the bar area afterwards lack any sofas or seat - many people be stand . give this a miss if you can . this be not even worth one star . 	
 May 1 2006 	 only stay for one night but would recommend 	 this hotel be easy to find from the tube station and also locate near a shopping centre . from our bedroom window we could see the Millenium Dome ! ! I have read other people 's review of this hotel but I do not use the pool or eat in the restaurant so I can not comment on those facility but if you be look for a hotel to impress this be the one . 	
 Apr 25 2006 	 average hotel - good location for Docklands 	 stay here for one night before the london marathon . pre - book room on a discount website - check - in be very fast and efficient . room be very large - look like it have be re - furbish recently but bathroom certainly have not be redecorate for a while . everything work apart from the Air Con that be rubbish ( a number of other review have state this ) do not eat at restaurant as I point blank refuse to spend £ 14 on breakfast . Location be good , 5 minute walk from Herons Quay dlr station - nice view over London . fast , efficient checkout and a concierge service to look after your bag ( charge £ 1 per item per day)in conclusion - a decent hotel if you be look for a dockland base trip . 	
 Apr 24 2006 	 would not return to the Britannia International 	 my husband and I book this hotel as a treat for our first wedding anniversary , on paper the hotel seem very nice - especially it be location , but in practice it be a complete let down . the hotel reception area be very nice but be not a true reflection on the rest of the hotel . the room be basic - you could find more luxury in a Travel Lodge - but the view from the bedroom window be exceptional . the staff speak extremely basic English which be really akward when ask general question about the hotel facility or direction - they be also really unhelpful . we have take with we a vintage bottle of champagne which we want to drink in our room on our actual wedding anniversary - they begrudge we two champagne glass . the weekend also have hide charge such as you be not allow to take towel from your room to the pool and instead have to pay to hire towel in the pool area , which be something I have never hear of . the pool area itself have mould on the ceiling and wire hang down which be neither pleasant nor safe and we be ' grunt ' at when we ask for change for the locker . Breakfast be a fiasco in itself . usually you be give some instruction as to where to sit or to help yourself to the buffett . we recieve neither and be make to sit at a dirty table and be expect to use up the rest of the pot of tea that have be leave from the people before we - we be make well aware of the inconvieniance we be cause by ask for a fresh one . the final straw arrive when we have ask the night before for a one hour extention to our check out time - which surprisingly we be grant only for the receptionist to try and charge we for the extra hour as nobody have write down the extention we have be give . the one save grace for the weekend be the location of the hotel - Canary Wharf be a fantastic place with fantastic shopping / restaurant etc and be also really easy to get to central london - a visit to the Wharf be a must . however , I would not recommend a stay at the Brittania International Hotel due to the exceptionally poor service and accomodation that be much in need to a face lift . 	
 Apr 4 2006 	 you will not get a well deal in London 	 the Britannia International Hotel offer jacuzzi room , carvery restaurant , hotel bar , car parking , swimming pool , gym and a cool canary wharf location . anyone who give this hotel less than 4 star on this have never travel before . sound advice for travel in London - & quot;if you want your bag take up to the room , ask somebody&quot;.I stay here on valentine day , in a jacuzzi room for 75 pound through hotel - Assist . excellent price , have dinner with the Thames just 2 inch from our table , in the riverside restaurant , and there be a wedding in the hotel banquet room - can not be that bad if people get marry here . do not be put off of this hotel by people rant , they would be more at home in a 2 star hotel , whine about anything and everything . go here and you will be pleased ! 	
 Mar 31 2006 	 horrible hotel 	 I be give this hotel one star , just because it be actually mean to be a 4 - star hotel . room be average , service be dramatic , and staff be rude . avoid this hotel . you can do well . 	
 Mar 12 2006 	 unfortunately can not say good thing about the Britannia International 	 we just return from London where we stay three night at the Park Lane Hotel in Piccadilly and then four night at the Britannia International in Canary Wharf . whereas the Park Lane Hotel be very nice , we can not say the same about the Britannia . to be short and to the point , I shall mention the thing that need to be fixed:1 . the din room that serve breakfast ( Jenny 's ) be far from be clean . the plate and glass be plain filthy as be the cutlery . I want to take an egg cup for a soft boil egg but there be not one clean one . I also notice how the staff set the table , hold cup with their thumb in the cup and the fork by the tip of the fork instead of the handle . the floor be outright dirty . Service be non - existent . we have to call out several time for some pass staffer to bring we coffee . yet , their be several staff member / waiter just stand around do nothing . the food buffet be not arrange nicely and be not attractive . one evening , we have dinner at the same restaurant and even then the service be awful and it be dirty.2 . the room decor be very unattractive , but that be not the staff 's fault . what be their fault , be that the room be very stuffy as the ventilation do not work properly and the bathroom sink be clog . we ask housekeeping to fix those two thing , but nothing be do . so , to solve the air problem we want to open a window . in order to open and close the window , one have to call the concierge , which we do . we then leave the room and come back much later to find that it have rain in and that somebody from housekeeping have draw the curtain over the open window , but nobody actually close it , so it get wet all around the window.3 . we have two phone message , both important . there be no message light blink or on , so we have no way of know that we have message wait . only many hour later ( one be actually the next morning ) , do we receive a phone call with the message . that be not service and there be no excuse for it.4 . we find the front desk staff polite but completely nonchalant . we ask wether we could check out one hour later and be tell that they would have to charge we BP10 for that . again , that be not a way to attract hotel guest to come back . I see that the Britannia Hotels be try very hard to improve their internet booking . may be they should rather look at improve their hotel , at least this one . I for once , will never recommend to anyone to stay at this hotel and after this experience , I doubt that we will even want to try another Britannia Hotel . 	
 Mar 1 2006 	 ok nothing special 	 we stay here for the London Marathon Weekend as they be offer a package through the hotel . te experience be pretty bland , the room be ok ( although two twin bed push together be not a double ) , and the service be ok ( nobody help with bag and our room be not ready even though we arrive after the advertised check in time).We order breakfast to be deliver to the room ( as we have 26 mile to run we want a bit of substinance ) . this do not arrive and we have to get something and eat it on the way , although they still manage to charge we for this breakfast!On the whole , we get a very cheap price and have an ok stay . 	
 Feb 17 2006 	 pretty nice but uncomfortable bed 	 I decide to stay at the Britannia since it be half the price of the Marriott . the room be very nice - sort of an antique feel , without feel & quot;old&quot ; . I stay in a superior room , which be the size of a standard US room . my only gripe be the & quot;double bed&quot ; , which be really 2 single bed push together . the mattress be very thin and not very comfortable . but I get a room with a great view of the water , and the staff be generally friendly . 	
 Jan 25 2006 	 watch out if you be from a EUR country 	 when check out with a non - uk credit card , the hotel try to force you to pay in EUR instead of GBP , use a rate that be much high than the rate commonly charge through credit card . when comment that I´d like to pay in local currency , i.e. GBP , only , the hotel staff start use strange argument and be very unfriendly when one insist on pay in GBP . this have happen several time now . I find this behaviour ( that have happen to my colleague as well ) very strange . I think I have the right to pay in local currency ! 	
 Jan 3 2006 	 what more could you ask for ? ! ? ! ? 	 my boyfriend book this hotel for my 21st and it have be the good hotel I have stop in . I feel like a celebrity walk into reception on the red carpet . the room be lovely and I have a gorgeous view of canary whalf , millenium dome and the river along with all the building in the Docklands . its a bit out of the way to get to west end . the only thing I can fault on be the breakfast which I be totally disgust in . so I m glad I do not actually pay for it as it come with a deal as part of the hotel . I will definetely be stop here again ! 	
 Jan 2 2006 	 a forgetable experience 	 a clean and value for money room with the discount rate , but the buffet breakfast be a stampede on the first morning . the four star rating be very questionable , with the health studio and swimming pool one of the most unhygenic that I have see . will not be return . Mike G. 	
 oct 9 2005 	 my bad hotel experience 	 I pull up in a taxi and see three man , who appear to work for the hotel , stand around talk to each other . when none of they come to help I with my bag I assume they be not hotel staff after all . silly I . I check in . still no mention of anyone to help with my bag , so I lumber up to my room myself . the level of service describe by this introduction to the Britannia turn out to be utterly representative of the rest of my experience . on my first morning , I do not receive my request wake - up call . one night I come back to the hotel at about 11:15pm . I need a quick meal and to get to bed . I try to phone room service and could not get through . I finally phone the front desk and they say they would get they to phone I . 10 minute later I give up wait and after a couple more try get through to room service . they never get the message . I order a turkey and cranberry sandwich - it seem like the least offensive option on an extremely limited sandwich - only menu . when it arrive 45 minute later , it turn out to be the most disgusting food I have ever be serve in a hotel . without a shred of exageration , the bread be stale , the turkey be represent by a thin slice of some process turkey food product , there be not a trace of cranberry on it ( and that be the only hope for flavor on this sandwich ) , and , bad of all , the lettuce be not only completely limp , but in place it be actually black and slimy with rot - the kind of thing that anyone else would have throw away day ago . it be utterly insulting to be serve that sandwich . when I complain , hold up a piece of the limp rotten lettuce , the room service waiter say ' that be the Britannia ' . straight from the horse 's mouth . the replacement sandwich - hold the lettuce - be not much well but I manage to get some of it down before put myself to bed shortly before 1:00am . the epilogue to that story be equally unreal . I have leave the room service tray in my room . housekeeping have remove it and place it in the hallway , where it remain . it be there when I get back to my room at 10:00pm the next night , and it be there when I peek my head out the door at midnight . to their credit , it be go by morning , and so be I. when I get into the cab the driver figure I be go to the airport . no , I say , go to a different hotel . the driver laugh - it be not the first time he have ferry weary Britannia surviver to alternate accommodation . one comment he offerre be about the number of time he have pull up with guest only to find the staff stand around talk , with absolutely no intention of help anyone with their bag . in fairness , there be one waiter in the breakfast room who give good service . I will never consider stay at the Britannia again . 	
 Aug 23 2005 	 huge room great breakfast 	 Twin room very spacious , nice view over Canary Wharf to Millenium dome , dockland railway outside window but do not disturb we , breakfast excellent value , we have a three course feast . take a bit of time to get there on underground , but Jubilee line quite speedy . leisure facility could do with a coat of paint and bit of TLC . last Minute price deal excellent - full price out of my range . 	
 Jun 12 2005 	 a mixed bag 	 having stay at the Hilton Docklands 3 week early it be interesting to compare the two . on the plus side the room we have in the International be big and access to the both the Docklands Light Railway ( DLR ) and the Tube be only a 5 minute walk away . on the down side , the breakfast be bad than the Hilton with no yoghurt or muesli and no sign tell you what sort of milk or juice you be drink . the promise free bottle of wine never materialise and as the weather be warm we keep the window open only to be deafen by the sound of the dlr as it go over the bridge between South Quays and Heron Quays station . I find it very strange that there be such a big difference in the rating between this hotel and the Hilton across the river - I think that take all thing into account there be little difference . 	
 Jun 10 2005 	 Bland ! 	 after read all the bad review be somewhat apprehensive about stay here . check in be ok , but as mention before double bed be 2 single push together . Breakfast be ok . bad point be the horrendous stifle heat in the bedroom at night time , the a / c must kick off . everywhere include the non - smoking room smell of stale tobacco and the entire hotel need a revamp . major gripe be that you can not use the phone in your room unless you authorise £ 50 against your credit card to have it activate . dont think I would stay here again . 	
 May 30 2005 	 somewhat ordinary 	 Hotel be o.k . but unspectacular . we stay one night only . the exterior be brutish and somewhat unwelcoming . unfortunately , the interior ( once you have clear reception ) vary between the garish , date and downright tacky . the hotel badly need an overhaul . the decor need enliven . Staff be fine though . bad bit be the leisure facility . the pool be in a really poor state - with peel plastework in evidence and mould all over the ceiling . for a purportedly 4 star hotel , I think the owner must really do well than this . I would pitch it at more like 2/3 star - so to this extent £ 125 for a night for a weekend break family room do not feel like the good value I think it would be ! ! we spend the two previous night in a Premier Travel Inn at £ 48 a night . it be no bad than the International ...... 	
 Apr 28 2005 	 Excellent Stay 	 Excellent Hotel and a great location , many bar and shop close by . also just a short walk away from the Undergound and DLR . 	
 Apr 9 2005 	 good hotel but noisy 	 recently take a 2 day break in this hotel . extremely easy to find right in the centre of Docklands and next to Canary Wharf tower . easy to drive to hotel with car parking at £ 15 per day underneath . can also be reach by Docklands light railway and Canary Wharf underground station on the Jubilee line . both stop around 10 minute walk from hotel . initially presentation of entrance and reception to hotel very good . staff be very helpful , with a tang of european accent as be the case in many uk hotel now . Room be perfectly adequate twin with ensuite . great view over London and the River Thames from the 12th floor . price be excellent value with a leisure break only cost around £ 150 include breakfast for both night . easy to book room on line . large amount of building work currently take place in the area although this be mainly confine to the work hour of 8 - 5 and do not cause we any problem with noise . look like planning permission have be grant for large 15 tower building to be erect next to the hotel but this have not start yet but will certainly restrict hotel view when complete probably in a couple of year time and I would suggest will create noise whilst be build . big noise problem we experience be the light railway which be elevate across the dock below . this run every 3 minute from 5.30am to midnight and sound like a jet plane take off . should get use to this after the first night and do make interesting view from the hotel room . hotel be well place just outside the hustle and bussle of central London which can be reach by tube , bus or railway in 30 minute from the hotel . 	
 Apr 6 2005 	 you can probably do well 	 my husband and I live in London and need a place to stay between lease . we be at Britannia for a week and then at the Novotel Greenwich ( which be much well ) . this hotel do have good point . it be convenient to Canary Wharf the DLR and Jubilee line . the room and bathroom be spacious and clean enough with old style furnishing that may be consider quaint ( or tacky ) . the concierge on duty in the evening be fantastic . the restaurant and pizzaria food be overprice for the quality . but the bad part be the uncomfortable bed and the eternity spend in the lift every day . we do not have a good night 's sleep all week . we pay about 100 pound per night and that be too much . the Novotel Greenwich be a little more out of the way , but we only spend about 75 per night there for an excellent hotel . 	
 Mar 15 2005 	 what a wonderfull hotel 	 this hotel be wonderfull , I could not fault it other that the breakfast be very overpriced , two bowle of cereal and a cupper for nearly £ 13.the room we have be a Jacuzzi room I be actually supprise how good it was(go easy on the bubble bath that thing multiply they ) , it be a very large room with a very nice view , the staff be helpfull without be intrusive , the dinner in the resaurant be fab a 3 course meal for only £ 13.50 bargain no matter where you come from . the bar be comfortable with a view over the river , and most important it be clean through out .You will not be dissapointe . 	
 Mar 1 2005 	 good lively hotel ! 	 I ve stay here a number of time now , the room be average in size and have a old style decor but be clean and comfortable . Breakfast be a tasty all you can eat buffet . the good bit of this hotel be the bar which seem to stay open till 5 am in the week and 3 am at the weekend . really nice friendly atmosphere . I would definately stay here again . price vary but seem to be cheepest to book it through the hotel group website . 	
 Feb 19 2005 	 look great actually very average 	 I have stay in the Britannia a couple of time and have be amazed at the fluctuate level of service . there have be time when I have be happy here but there seem to be no middle - ground in term of service ( which can be truly dreadful ) and quality of the room . I be sure that when it first open it be great but the general over - the - top decor and chintzy look belie the fact that this hotel really be not that good . expect to wait age to check - out and for the lift ( which seem to break - down a lot ) . also expect to have a fairly shambolic breakfast serve by hard - work import staff that speak little English . I understand that this hotel teeter on the edge of exclusion by most major travel company book for business e.g. Hogg Robinson / BTI and it be easy to see why ... the Hilton , Docklands be on the other side of the river but be actually a much well hotel - and be only an extra 10 minute away . alternatively , big budget should stretch to the Four season which be excellent . 	
 Dec 4 2004 	 good for a night not a long holiday ... 	 I stay at the Britannia International Hotel for a night for a very dicounted price . my room be comfortable and quiet with a lovely view but the furniture and bedsheet / blanket be certainly in need of replacement . the staff be delightful , as they be completely overbooke the following night they find I a hotel room in another hotel at a discount rate and this be extremely helpful . every staff person I meet be helpful so I have to disagree with some of the other review in term of staff . I would not stay here more than one night since I find the decor quite depressing and very outdated but the area be safe , convenient to the underground and a very nice shopping centre be nearby . the view from the hotel be brilliant but the interior definitely need some style and re - vamping , there be shabby reproduction of art , halogen lamp from the 80 and the most bizarre chandelier right above the window . I would stay again ( and perhaps for long ) if they rennovate a bit ! 	
 Nov 27 2004 	 good hotel just a few thing .... 	 we stay for 2 night over a weekend in November , and overall find the hotel a nice place . we get a really good rate of£60.00 per night for a fairly basic but pleasant double room that have a lovely view of the Thames . the downside be check in - we have to queue for 45 minute on a Saturday at 4 pm to check in .. when we finally get to the front the concierge ( who decide to help out on reception ) could not find our detail for 5 minute and explain she have not be train in all aspect of check in . when we check out on the Monday morning there be no queue but the hotel refuse to credit our £ 11.80 deposit we have already pay to the booking agent say they have not receive ( even though we have it in writing ! ) so we have to pay the full amount - we be still in the process of try to get this back!on the upside there be a lovely bar / lounge area we use after go in to the West end each night , and hotel be nicely locate just 5 minute walk from the tube station . would consider stay again but would double check the situation with deposit first ! 	
 Nov 7 2004 	 great choice ! ! ! 	 excellent choice for whatever purpose , even holiday , though the hotel be locate near the big business center of London ( Canary Wharf ) . the hotel be locate near the tube station and pretty modern shopping mall . there be also a dlr train station which can get you to the city center or to Greenwich in no time . if you get a room with a view on Canary Wharf side you will be amazed . the view be fantastic . room be pretty big , clean and bright . the only disadvatage of the hotel be that if you be there for the first time , it be pretty hard to find if you be out of the tube . but once you will get there , it all get easy . this hotel be pretty expensive so try to book in advance through the internet ( you can get 60 % discount rate).we've be there for a week ( 9 - 16 August 2004 ) , and we would surely return there . overall - great place . 	
 Nov 7 2004 	 glad I do not pay full price 	 we get a cheap room here for our first night in london after the flight , so we basically do not intend go sightseeing and just want to rest and take thing easy . find the room to be nice , the staff be polite . the only thing I could really find fault with be the fact that the room be very hot and the AC do not seem to make any difference and that the double bed be in fact 2 single mattress which make some thing a little hard ;) location be secluded and peaceful , room on a par with most other 4 * hotel I ve stay in around the world . would go again if the price be as good ( £ 70 ) but only as a first night after the long flight as there be very little to do in the local surround area . 	
 Sep 28 2004 	 get a suite ! 	 we be check in quickly by the helpful staff . unfortunately the legibility of the room number and departure date attach to the key mean we have to return to the desk to re - confirm both . the date of departure look decidedly more like a 25 than a 26 , and despite several assurance from the desk staff I be glad to find our door key still work on the evening of the 25th . the room itself be adequate in size but I have a few issue with the maintenance of the room . the lavatory flush handle be hang precariously from the wall and have obviously be so for some time . the back of the remote control be miss and I have to keep the battery press in to make it work . I know these thing be as a result of misuse by previous guest but these be obvious defect which should have be sort out . our travel companion have a junior suite which be much well value . the view across London from the balcony be very impressive . I be disappoint with the rather petty £ 2.50 additional charge for the pool and leisure facility . I would have like to have comment on they as well but what they fail to mention at the time of booking be the restricted opening hour at the weekenddon’t get I wrong , the hotel be not all that bad and I have certainly stay in bad hotel in London ( some much bad ! ) . shop around for weekend discount – if you pay the full price you will feel very short change . get the suite if you can , it ’ well worth the extra . 	
 Sep 9 2004 	 Excellent hotel in a peaceful area by the water . 	 my sister and I stay at this hotel for four day during our stay in London and be very pleased with our choice . we get an excellent deal off the internet that include breakfast ( suppose to be continental but we be able to have a full english breakfast every morning from the breakfast buffet , in a nice dining room right next to the water ) . our room be comfortable with plenty of storage , and with air conditioning that work ! it have a nice , private view over the water . the twin bed be narrow than I be use to here in Canada , but they be adequate . tea and coffee service be provide in the room . the bathroom be large with a jacuzzi tub and a bidet ( do anyone actually use these?).the location be perfect for we . it be very quiet and peaceful there - no loud traffic noise . we be a short walk from the South Quay Station of the Docklands Light Railway , and the Canary Wharf underground station be a short walk along the pedestrian walkway , over the water , behind the hotel . this take we into the Jubilee shopping area and the Jubilee Underground line which be excellent , modern , clean , and easy to access . if you be look for a hotel that be right in the middle of the tourist attraction , then this be not it , but if you want excellent quality in a peaceful area , with easy access to the underground , then I highly recommend the Britannia International Docklands 	
 Sep 6 2004 	 4 star not here ! 	 this really be no 4 star hotel . I stay for a night on 27 Aug. I be unable to get into my executive room , despite 3 key change until a concierge & quot;thumped&quot ; the lock!The room be shabby , the bathroom poor and towel dingy coloured ( grey ) as oppsoe to their true colour white . the bin contain the wrapper from one of the two pack of allotted biscuit . I have no fridge and no newspaper . the hallway need cleaning and hotel staff must learn that do not disturb mean exactly that!The view and location be excellent and be worth 5 star . 	
 Aug 27 2004 	 definitely not a four star hotel 	 I be greatly disappoint by my brief stay at Britannia International Hotel . I visit London for both business and pleasure , and I be glad my stay in Britannia International be for only one night . I have absolutely no complaint about the local Docklands area . there be a great variety of cafe , shop and entertainment in the local area . the dockland view be very relaxing and the prestigious city building block remind you of New York or Boston skyscraper . the location be conveniently locate near the Canary Wharf train station which link to Tower Bridge ’s underground station . in a very short space of time you can travel directly to the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben , the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace . we manage to fit in a whirlwind tour of London in two hour ! it be a very good idea to buy an all - day travel pass on the local train , underground and bus , which can be buy at the train station for about £ 4.70 . the hotel be offer tour for £ 16 , so we make a big saving . the hotel on the other hand be a bit of a let down . the standard of service and room be the poor level I have ever experience in a " four star hotel " . the hotel be a three star hotel at good , and only because it contain a number of restaurant and a swimming pool . reception staff be rude and unfriendly , plus some do not have very good english skill . we order breakfast in bed , which the price be not state on the room service menu and it end up cost £ 21 ! the person who bring up our meal be again very unfriendly , speak little English and stand in the middle of our room when we be not yet dress properly . furthermore , the cleaner try to enter our room before 9 am ( some of we like a slight lie - in ! ) . Breakfast be not very exciting consist of a croissant , two small roll , some toast and standard cornflake , and not fresh orange . we go to the buffet restaurant to eat which be good value for money , but not a great standard of food . the room be fine , but be start to become a little shabby . the mirror in the bathroom be start to discolour , our lamp be on the verge of go in the bin , the bed sheet be old - fashioned and I ’m not very keen on shower curtain in hotel . however , there be some good point of the hotel . the good part of the hotel have to be the view . I decide to hold my business meeting at the lounge overlook the dock , which be a very civilised and relaxed setting . furthermore , I could not have any complaint about my room view , which look over the water and even partially show the Millennium Dome . I would not recommend stay in this hotel for a holiday break . it be ok for one night , but I ’ll be look for somewhere else in the Docklands area next time I visit .
